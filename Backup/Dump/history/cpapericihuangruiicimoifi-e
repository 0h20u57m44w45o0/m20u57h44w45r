Computational fluid dynamics has only recently[when?] reached a position to make reasonable computations in solving scramjet operation problems. Boundary layer modeling, turbulent mixing, two-phase flow, flow separation, and real-gas aerothermodynamics continue to be problems on the cutting edge of CFD. Additionally, the modeling of kinetic-limited combustion with very fast-reacting species such as hydrogen makes severe demands on computing resources. Reaction schemes are numerically stiff requiring reduced reaction schemes.

Unlike jet or rocket propulsion systems facilities which can be tested on the ground, testing scramjet designs uses extremely expensive hypersonic test chambers or expensive launch vehicles, both of which lead to high instrumentation costs. Tests using launched test vehicles very typically end with destruction of the test item and instrumentation.

In the solution of complex and dynamic fluid-solid systems involving hypersonic flow conditions, a balance for accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the underlying numerical framework is valuable. This balance requirement particularly applies to space discretization and numerical boundary treatment.

For compressible flows with hypersonic motions, the ability of capturing flow discontinuities is crucial to a spatial discretization scheme. One of the key ideas is to utilize the upwinding nature of a hyperbolic system according to the characteristics of the system. However, conservation laws in 2D and 3D spaces are frequently indefinite systems with eigenvalues of mixed sign, which depend on the local flow and can vary from point to point. In addition, the Jacobian matrix of the hypersonic system is generally a nonlinear function of the conservative variables. Therefore, the entire system of equations are tightly coupled. To extend numerical methods and ideas from scalar conservation laws to system of conservation laws, flux splitting techniques are widely used to facilitate the generalization process while conforming to the hyperbolic properties of the system.

AUSM treats the convective and pressure terms separately. The convective terms are upstream-biased using a properly defined cell-interface velocity, while the pressure term is strictly dealt with by using acoustic waves. ASUM was designed with the purpose of combining the efficiency of flux vector splitting and the accuracy of finite difference spliting. yielding vanishing numerical diffusivity at stagnation points. It does not involve matrix operation (does not involve differentiation of fluxes - Jacobian matrix, which is a great advantage for general equation of states) and is simple to construct.

As the motion of each particle follows Newton's second law, the instability arising from the dynamics of a particle system is unavoidable due to the stochastic nature of particle morphology (including size distribution), particle bed configu- ration and material properties. The instability of particle trajectories, for example during explosive dispersal, can cause clustering, collisions and agglomeration, which may lead to a significant change in the average particle dynamics and form a nonuniform spatial distribution or macroscopic particle jet structures. Careful studies of these fundamental differences, with the help of experiments and direct numerical simulations of a large number of particles at the “microscopic” particle scale, are necessary and may lead to a novel analysis of dissipative statistical mechanics.

\section{High Fidelity Simulation of Atmospheric Dispersion}

Understanding the dispersion of pollutants in atmospheric flow is of vital importance for infrastructure planning and urban development as well as forecasting the spread of air-borne hazards in outdoor and indoor environments. To provide analyses in minimal time, empirical approaches, like Gaussian puff methods and single or multizone models, are presently used. Puff methods assume an idealised outdoor emission plume and neglect interaction with complex topologies. Zone models can provide reasonable predictions of dispersion through buildings, but their applicability is questionable for large spaces, where their homogeneous mixing assumption is invalid.

Three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulations can overcome the limitations of empirical dispersion models, however the turn-around times for solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on complex meshes are enormous. As an alternative, a novel parallel adaptive lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for large eddy simulation (LES) of atmospheric flows is currently under development within our AMROC software framework. In this approach, geometries are represented with automatically generated Cartesian meshes that are non-uniformly refined and de-refined at run time.

In this PhD project, you will work on fine-tuning the LBM-LES approach for atmospheric dispersion prediction and supplement the method with the following features: realistic inflow conditions to model the atmospheric boundary layer, representation of complex release sources, efficient import of complex geometries. In addition, you will develop a version of the parallel LBM-LES code (written in C++) that is tailored especially for execution on sets of graphical processing units (GPUs) using CUDA or OpenACC. Together, these developments will lead to a step-change in atmospheric flow prediction. The new capability will be evaluated in close collaboration with subject matter experts at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) in Porton Down and you will spend at least 3 months in total on site.

The virtual flight and preliminary design of conceptual vehicles require running hundreds or even thousands of aerodynamic simulations. Practical computation of such large test matrices places a premium on automation of the entire simulation process and on automated control of data flow and job execution. In recent years, Cartesian mesh methods have made rapid strides toward the goal of fully automated aerodynamic analysis. Based on this technology, Ames researchers, with partners from the Courant Institute (New York University), have developed systems for automatically running the extremely large matrices of simulations required for preliminary design and virtual flight. When design permutations or control surface deflections modify the shape of a vehicle, the system automatically generates the new geometry, remeshes the design, and runs simulations covering a wide range of flight conditions.

turbulent atmospheric cloud, atmospheric turbulence.

Brief introduction: Fluid turbulence is often quoted as the last unsolved problem in classical
physics, a statement usually associated with R.P. Feynman (Nobel prize in Physics).
Turbulent flows and interaction between turbulence and particle/droplets is at the heart of
many processes in nature such as in the atmosphere (clouds, pollutants motion, weather-
climate feedback etc.) and many engineering processes such as inside combustion
engines, chemical and food processing, aircraft flights etc. However fundamental
understanding of these subject is challenging and represents the forefront of scientific
inquiry, owing to the non-linear and complex nature of these problems. Our lab aims at
better understanding turbulence and particle-turbulence interaction (with emphasis in
either atmospheric or engineering processes) using cutting-edge experimental and/or
computational methods and theoretical considerations.

supercomputer); numerical simulation and fundamental analysis of turbulent flows, with or
without particles; designing new experimental tools or techniques to observe

\section{Data Integrated Modelling of Fluid Flows and Forces}

Computational methods for predicting complex unsteady flows are computationally demanding, while full-field experimental methods are very expensive. This project is at the forefront of the emerging field of machine learning and data-driven computational modelling. The student will develop unique new models to predict fluid mechanic characteristics by integrating experimental data from high-resolution Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and force measurements into Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The resulting learning-based models will vastly reduce the computational cost of running CFD simulations. This reduction in cost will expand the potential applications of CFD into new areas such as generative design, digital twins, and life-cycle forecasting for engineering structures.

\section{Efficient and robust high-order simulation of the gas dynamics equations}

Full title: Efficient and robust high-order numerical simulation of the gas dynamics equations

Keywords: discontinuous Galerkin method, entropy stability, positivity preserving, compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations.

Context: This work will consider the nonlinear analysis of a robust high-order discretization, based on a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, of the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. Approximations based on expansion coefficients, such as the DG method, suffer from spurious oscillations in the vicinity of discontinuities due to the Gibbs phenomenon and may cause the solution to become locally nonphysical leading to robustness issues for the computation. Besides, DG methods are also prone to nonlinear instabilities due to under integration of the variational formulation of the nonlinear equations.  Stabilization techniques are thus necessary to restore positivity of the variables (density, internal energy, etc.) and nonlinear stability (via an entropy inequality) at the discrete level. The method introduced in [1,2] is based on a DG approximation in space and a decomposition between acoustic and transport operators associated to an implicit-explicit time integration, thus relaxing the constraint of acoustic waves on the time step as proposed in [3].  Conditions on the time step and on numerical dissipation parameters are derived to keep positivity of the discrete density and internal energy and to satisfy a discrete inequality for the physical entropy at any approximation order of the discretization. Numerical experiments highlight stability and robustness of the present method for a wide range of applications from low Mach number to supersonic flows.

investigation of the method when applied to multiple space dimensions on
non-structured meshes and to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. A
nonlinear analysis of the discrete scheme will be applied to investigate its
properties (positivity, nonlinear stability, etc.). Other techniques for the
time integration that avoid the splitting of operators will also be considered.
Numerical experiments in the code Aghora developed at Onera will be conducted to
assess the performances of the method. The results will be the subject of
publications in journals and scientific conferences.

\title{Discontinusous Galerkin + subcell WENO reconstruction for interfacial values}

\section{Structural reactive material}

Metal reactive materials such as Aluminum have large combustion energy densities. When experiencing high-strain-rate plastic deformation, these materials can provide significant energy release for high explosives through intermetallic reactions and oxidation initiated by the heat generated from shear instability and local plastic deformation as well as fragmentation in the shear band. However, under an explosive loading, the energy release rate of metal reactive materials strongly depends on the metal particle sizes. For instance, in order to complete oxidation within $1 \Unit{ms}$, the diameters of Al particles requires to be on the order of about $20 \Unit{\mu m}$, which is very difficult to generate from the explosive expansion of either homogeneous solid Al samples or consolidated Al powders. In order to overcome the magnitude discrepancy between the characteristic size of explosively fragmented solid/porous Al and the required size of Al for fast oxidation, a highly heterogeneous granular material combing Al and W components is introduced to establish the \emph{in situ} generation of small size Al fragments under explosive loadings. The high heterogeneity of this material, which mostly originates from component density differences, facilitates the pulverization of the material with fragment sizes determined by the initial mesostructure of the material rather than the self-organization of macrocracks. Through conducting explosive fragmentation of Al-W rings under the same conditions of the explosive fragmentation of densified Al powders to elucidate the effects of mesostructures on fragment sizes, it is demonstrated that highly heterogeneous Al-W granular materials can produce characteristic sizes much smaller than those of homogeneous solid/porous Al materials under the same explosive loading conditions \citep{chiu2017dynamic}.

For the purpose of preserving both high energy density and mechanical strength, a fine granular mixture of reactive materials is consolidated to form a structural reactive material (SRM) solid made of various metal elements and compounds and towards the theoretical maximum density with little porosity. In order to augment air blast through the rapid oxidation of the reactive materials, a SRM solid should be effectively fragmented into fine fragments under given explosive loadings. A reactive hotspot concept that uses the intermetallic reactions of microsized reactive additives such as $\Des{MoO}_3$ distributed in a base SRM solid such as $\Des{Al}$ to create microscale hotspots is investigated to initiate local fractures and to produce subsequent fine fragments of a SRM solid. Experimental results demonstrated that a SRM solid casing can produce an observable larger amount of fine fragments than that of a pure Al casing, and the prompt reaction of the produced fine fragments after detonation significantly enhanced the primary and near-field blast waves \citep{zhang2017dynamic}.

The mesostructures of the formed granular ring such as interfaces resulting from the grain-scale heterogeneities in shape, density, impedance, and hardness create structure discontinuities \citep{chiu2017dynamic}, and the intermetallic reactions under explosive loading creates mesoscale hotspots \citep{zhang2017dynamic}, which initiate local fractures.

\section{Deduced jetting process}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Under shock compaction, a large pressure difference is created between the inside and outside of the particle bed, which accelerates flow through the particle bed and the particle bed itself. Inner-layer particles experience high-strain-rate plastic deformation and agglomerate to form a solid ring with granular dissimilarity;
    \item The mesostructures of the formed granular ring such as interfaces resulting from the grain-scale heterogeneities in shape, density, impedance, and hardness create structure discontinuities \citep{chiu2017dynamic}, and the intermetallic reactions under explosive loading creates mesoscale hotspots \citep{zhang2017dynamic}, which initiate local fractures;
    \item High-speed fluid jets form at the fractures of the solid ring. These fluid jets force the clustering of outer-layer particles, producing particle jets. As a result, the fragmented ring dictates the number of jets.
\end{enumerate}

The computed dispersal process of the particle system in the form of numerical Schlieren is presented. During the particle dispersal, complex shock-shock, shock-particle, and particle-particle interactions are resolved. When reaching the particle payload, shocks diffract and reflect over the particle surfaces. Diffracted shocks propagate along particle surfaces and later collide at the concave regions, forming locally heavy fluids. Richtmyer--Meshkov instability is then induced by the injection of the heavy fluid into ambient light fluid. The reflected shock waves propagate back toward the payload after coalescing at the domain center, which then collide with the growing fluid jets and severely disturb the jet structure. The impacts of repetitive reflected shocks effectively destabilize the particle system, producing gaps among particles. High-speed fluid jets are then generated at those gaps, which further fracture the particle system.

\section{Unsteady drag analysis and model using mesoscale modeling}

\subsection{Overall drag calculation}

A shock wave with three shock Mach numbers $M_{\Des{s}} = 1.22$, $1.40$, and $1.45$ impacts on a particle curtain immersed in an initial temperature $300 \Unit{K}$ and absolute pressure $84.1 \Unit{kPa}$. Particle diameter $D_{\Des{p}} = 106-125 \Unit{\mu m}$ and $300-355 \Unit{\mu m}$ corresponding to curtain width $\delta = 1.5 \Unit{mm}$ and $3.5 \Unit{mm}$, respectively \citep{demauro2017unsteady}. 

Particle volume fraction $\phi$:
\begin{equation}
    \phi = \frac{\sum_{p}m_p}{A\delta}
\end{equation}

    \label{fig:drag_shock_curtain}
\end{figure}

Estimation of the overall drag as a function of time
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Control volume approach (Fluid perspective)

        Through applying momentum conservation to the control volume, the overall external force exerted on the control volume has
        \begin{equation}
            \Vector{F}_{\Des{E}} = \frac{\partial }{\partial t} \int_{\Omega}^{} \rho \Vector{V} \,\mathrm{d}\Omega + \int_{S}^{} \unitVector{n} \cdot (\rho \Vector{V}\Vector{V} + p \unitTensor{I}) \,\mathrm{d}S
        \end{equation}
        where $\Omega$, $S$, and $\unitVector{n}$ are the spatial domain, boundary surface, and unit outward normal vector of the control volume, respectively. $\unitTensor{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor.

        Using the one-dimensional flow assumption and the control volume property, the overall drag has
        \begin{equation}
            \Vector{F}_{\Des{D}} = \frac{\partial }{\partial t} \int_{\Omega}^{} \rho u \,\mathrm{d}\Omega - \int_{A_{\Des{L}}}^{} (\rho u^2 + p) \,\mathrm{d}A_{\Des{L}} + \int_{A_{\Des{R}}}^{} (\rho u^2 + p) \,\mathrm{d}A_{\Des{R}}
        \end{equation}
        Compared to the control volume analysis established on experimental measurements \citep{demauro2017unsteady}, the presented analysis exempts from additional assumptions on the value distribution of involved flow quantities, as all the required information is readily available via the mesoscale modeling. 

    \item Force integration approach (Particle perspective)
        \begin{equation}
            \Vector{F}_{\Des{D}} = \sum_{p}^{} \Vector{f}_{\Des{D},p}
        \end{equation}
        where $\Vector{f}_{\Des{D},p}$ is the drag force on the $p$-th particle.
\end{enumerate}
The overall drag calculations can only be applied to one-dimensional flows, in which all the drag forces on individual particles are in the same direction.

\subsection{Drag law} \label{subsec:Drag law}

Drag model for individual particles
\begin{equation}
    \Vector{f}_{\Des{D},p} = f(\Vector{u}_p, \Vector{u}_f)
\end{equation}
where $\Vector{u}_p$ is the particle velocity, and $\Vector{u}_f$ is the ambient fluid velocity.

Such as in Discrete Element Model (DEM): The interaction between the two phases is incorporated by drag force correlations, which depend on the local relative velocity of the phases and the local solid volume fraction.
\begin{equation}
    \Vector{f}_{\Des{D},p} = \frac{V_{p,i} \beta}{1 - \phi} (\Vector{u}_{f} - \Vector{u}_{p,i})   
\end{equation}
where $V_{p,i}$ is the particle volume of the $i$-th particle, $\beta$ is the momentum exchange coefficient between the solid and fluid phase, $\phi$ is the void fraction of particle bed, $\Vector{u}_f$ is fluid velocity, and $\Vector{u}_{p,i}$ is particle velocity of the $i$-th particle.

\section{Jet formation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Simulations:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item 2D
            \item 3D
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Analysis and models for two velocities:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item maximum expansion velocity of surface layer of particles
            \item particle velocity within the dense expanding solid flow (or sometimes called "drag" law in dense solid flow still involving collisions)
            \item Gurney velocity deficit with regard to maximum expansion velocity of surface layer of particles
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Comments:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The relation of $M/C$ ratio on jetting ($M$ is the solid payload mass and $C$ is the driver fluid mass). With an increase in $M/C$ (more layers of particles), the jet number would decrease due to more dissipation of fluid jets in the solid payload. Eventually there would be not jetting instability at a certain large $M/C$. Instead, the outer layers of particles would expand radially more uniformly.
            \item Increase the driver density. The real explosive density is on the order of $10^3 kg/m^3$, while the particles (say, Al) have a density of $2700kg/m^3$. Due to the computer power, you may not reach the real densities. But an increase in driver density and make it different from the ambient would make the problem more realistic.
            \item Can you do the problem where the high pressure driver is in the direct contact with the particulate payload?
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Cases}

\subsection{Subsonic flow around a cylinder}

The subsonic viscous flow around a cylinder resulting from the passing of a uniform free-stream flow $(\rho_{\infty}, u_{\infty}, v_{\infty}, p_{\infty})=(1.176 \Unit{kg/m^3}, 34.7 \Unit{m/s}, 0, 101327 \Unit{Pa})$ is computed to validate the proposed field function applied to subsonic fluid-solid interactions. For flow around a cylinder, when the Reynolds number of the free-stream flow, $Re$, is less than about $47$, the flow is steady, and two symmetric recirculating vortices form behind the cylinder. As $Re$ increases to a higher value, the flow becomes unsteady with vortex shedding \citep{gao2007improved}. In the present calculation, flow conditions with $Re=20$, $40$, $100$, and $200$ are considered, which cover both the steady and unsteady flow regimes and have a considerable amount of published data for comparison.

As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:flow_cylinder_demo_a}, a cylinder with diameter $D=1 \Unit{m}$ is positioned in a domain of size $L \times H = [0, 45D] \times [0, 30D]$, and the center of the cylinder is located at $C(10D, 15D)$. A subsonic inflow condition is imposed at the left domain boundary, in which the flow states have the same values as the free-stream ones except that the density is extrapolated, and the outflow condition is used for the right domain boundary. In addition, the slip-wall boundary condition is applied for the lower and upper domain boundaries, while the no-slip wall boundary condition is enforced on the cylinder. The dynamic viscosity of the flow is set to a constant value determined from $\mu = \rho_{\infty} u_{\infty} D / Re$. After a grid convergence test, a $1350\times900$ grid was found to be sufficient for producing reliable results, which has a grid resolution of about $0.03D$ ($30$ nodes per diameter) and is comparable to the grid resolutions used in references \citep{gao2007improved, brehm2015locally}.

As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:flow_cylinder_demo_b}, the steady flows can be quantified through a variety of vortex parameters such as the vortex location $a$, vortex distance $b$, length of separation $c$, and angle of separation $\theta$. In addition, the drag coefficient $C_{\Des{D}} = F_x / (0.5\rho_{\infty} u_{\infty}^2 D)$ can be used to validate the force behaviour, where $F_x$ is the $x$-component of the total force acting on the cylinder.

The predicted local streamlines of the steady flows at Reynolds numbers $Re=20$ and $Re=40$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1_cyn_vortex_stream_steady}. As the Reynolds number increases, the attached, steady, and symmetric vortex pair grow in length. A comparison of the predicted flow properties with the published ones in the literature is presented in Table~\ref{tab:1_cyn_vortex_para_steady}, in which excellent agreement is presented among all the quantities of interest.

The temporal evolution of the unsteady flows at $Re=100$ and $200$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1_cyn_vortex_stream_unsteady}, in which the development of von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n vortex shedding in the wake region is captured in detail. The unsteady flows can be quantified via several flow parameters, such as the Strouhal number $St = f D / u_{\infty}$, drag coefficient $C_{\Des{D}}$, and lift coefficient $C_{\Des{L}} = F_y / (0.5\rho_{\infty} u_{\infty}^2 D)$, where $f$ is the vortex shedding frequency (in this study, two point probes are positioned at $(15D, 15D)$ and $(20D, 15D)$ to record the time signals of the $y$-component of the velocity, whose FFT are then used to determine the vortex shedding frequency) and $F_y$ is the $y$-component of the total force acting on the cylinder, respectively. A comparison of flow results is shown in Table~\ref{tab:1_cyn_vortex_para_unsteady}, in which good agreement is obtained.

\section{}

Ablator: something that conducts heat poorly, boils at the right temperature, and has an extremely high latent heat of vaporisation. The point of an ablative heat shield is that material slowly boils way, and in doing so, carries away heat. Carbon-carbon composite don't ablate, they're just crazy heat resistant. Ablative heat shields are usually made of phenolic plastics or cork.

the ablative material is essentially a sacrificial layer of materials that boil off of the surface of the heat shield. The material boils off and caries waste heat away from the spacecraft essentially cooling the heat shield.

Imagine a hot summer day and you spray water on your neck. The water absorbs heat from your skin and the air around you. When the water absorbs enough heat, it evaporates and caries that heat energy away from your body. In this example the water is the "ablative material"

Ablator is a resource that is a vital component of most heat shields. During atmospheric entry, ablator will slowly be consumed, dissipating heat in the process. Ablator can not be replenished or transferred between parts. If a heat shield runs out of ablator it will stop preventing overheating for shielded parts. Ablation shields work by allowing the material to burn away to dissipate heat. The exception to this is the Heat Shield (10m), which relies on drag to slow it down before overheating. As of version 1.2.2, an overheating bar shows up on ablative heat shields. This bar never reaches the point of explosion reentering at "sane" speeds, but will do so when ablator runs out or the entry is too fast or long. Ablator is consumed when closer than 2,500 Megameters from kerbol.
