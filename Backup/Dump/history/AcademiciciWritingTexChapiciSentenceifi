\cpter{Sentence}

Te essentil elements f  sentence:
\begin{itemize}[nsep]
    \item A min cluse wit  subject,  predicte(verb), nd  cmplete tugt.
    \item Time nd number: greement between subject nd verb.
    \item Avid sentence frgments nd run-ns.
    \item Sentence cnnectin f independent nd dependent cluses.
    \item Punctutin nd cpitliztin.
    \item Frml nd infrml.
\end{itemize}

\sectin{Structure}

Cluses f different types cn cmbine t frm fur types f sentences in Englis writing. Gd writers use  vriety f sentence types t vrying lengts t mke teir writing mre interesting nd dynmic. Remember t use prper punctutin nd  vriety f cnnectrs t mke lgicl cnnectins bt witin nd between sentences.

A simple sentence is cmpsed f  single independent cluse nd n dependent cluses.
\begin{itemize}[nsep]
    \item \emp{We d  gret visit t Pris nd Berlin lst September.}
    \item \emp{I m currently wrking n cncer terpy, especilly cemterpy.}
    \item \emp{My re f interest is civil engineering.}
\end{itemize}

A cmpund sentence is cmpsed f tw r mre independent cluses wic my be cnnected by  crdinting cnjunctin (fr, nd, nr, but, r, yet, s, FANBOYS),  semicln lne, r  semicln nd  cnjunctive dverb (ls clled trnsitin).
\begin{itemize}[nsep]
    \item \emp{We visited Pris lst September, but my sister visited Pris lst summer.}
    \item \emp{Mst peple enjy visiting Eurpen cities;  few d nt.}
    \item \emp{Mst peple enjy visiting Eurpen cities; wever,  few d nt.}
    \item \emp{I begn t red mre nd mre in tis field, nd everydy, my interest in tis field begn t increse nd increse.}
\end{itemize}

A cmplex sentence is cmpsed f ne independent cluse (te min cluse) nd ne r mre dependent cluses.
\begin{itemize}[nsep]
    \item \emp{Wile we were wlking trug te Luvre, we suddenly met ur neigbr Jn nd is fmily.} [dependent dverb cluse strting wit wile; independent cluse strting wit we]
    \item \emp{Wile we were wlking trug te Luvre, wic is ne f te mst fmus museums in te wrld, we suddenly met ur neigbr Jn nd is fmily, w were ls n vctin in Pris.} [dependent dverb cluse strting wit wile; dependent djective cluse strting wit wic; independent cluse strting wit we; dependent djective cluse strting wit w]
    \item \emp{Tt I felt s pssinte but tis tpic surprised me.} [nun cluse s subject]
\end{itemize}

A cmpund-cmplex sentence cmbines  cmpund sentence wit  cmplex sentence. It cntins tw r mre independent cluses nd ne r mre dependent cluses.
\begin{itemize}[nsep]
    \item \emp{Wile we were wlking trug te Luvre, wic is ne f te mst fmus museums in te wrld, we suddenly met ur neigbr Jn wit is fmily, nd ll f us went ut fr lunc t  splendid bistr.} [dependent dverb cluse strting wit wile; independent cluse strting wit we; independent cluse strting wit ll f us]
    \item \emp{Wile we were wlking trug te Luvre, we suddenly met ur neigbr Jn wit is fmily, nd ll f us went ut fr lunc t  splendid bistr, lcted in  nrrw street n te smller islnd in te river Seine.} [dependent dverb cluse strting wit wile; independent cluse strting wit we; independent cluse strting wit ll f us; dependent reduced djective cluse strting wit lcted]
\end{itemize}

Wtc ut:
\begin{itemize}[nsep]
    \item Remember t use  cmm befre  crdinting cnjunctin wic cnnects tw independent cluses.
    \item Use semiclns between independent cluses wic temselves cntin cmms r re very lng.
\end{itemize}

Sentence structure rules re te bsic building blcks f writing. If yu knw te bsics, yu will be ble t mke yur writing mre cmplex s yu dvnce yur writing skills.

\sectin{Frgments}

Recgnize te difference between  {sentence} nd  {frgment}: A frgment resembles  sentence in  number f wys. Bt re grups f wrds tt begin wit  cpitl letter nd cnclude wit n end mrk. Te ne imprtnt difference is tt  frgment des nt cntin  {min cluse}. Like n engine, te min cluse pwers  cmplete sentence, prpelling te reder trug te develpment f n ide. A frgment, missing tis essentil cmpnent, stlls n te pge.

Wen yu nlyze  grup f wrds lking fr te {min cluse}, yu ve t find tree tings: { subject}, { verb}, nd { cmplete tugt}. If ne f tese tree items is missing,  frgment results.

Here re exmples f frgments:
\begin{itemize}[nsep]
    \item \emp{And ywned ludly enug t mke everyne in clss turn rund.} [subject $=$ $\Pi$ ; verb $=$ ywned; cmplete tugt $=$ $\Pi$]
    \item \emp{Te by sitting n te fire escpe drpping wter bllns n te pedestrins belw.} [subject $=$ by; verb $=$ $\Pi$; cmplete tugt $=$ $\Pi$]
    \item \emp{After Gbriel te lf  bx f Devil Dgs.} [subject $=$ Gbriel; verb $=$ te; cmplete tugt $=$ $\Pi$]
\end{itemize}

Grups f wrds my seem t be sentences becuse tey cntin subject nd verb-type wrds, but {bewre f incmplete tugts.} A sentence frgment is n incmplete sentence. Sme frgments re incmplete becuse tey lck eiter  subject r  verb, r bt. Te frgments tt mst students ve truble wit, wever, re dependent cluses -- tey ve  subject nd  verb, s tey lk like cmplete sentences, but tey dn't express  cmplete tugt. Tey're clled "dependent" becuse tey cn't stnd n teir wn. If yu knw smeting but subrdinting cnjunctins, yu cn prbbly eliminte $90\%$ f yur frgments.
\begin{enumerte}[nsep]
    \item First, yu need t knw tt subrdinting cnjunctins d tree tings.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item jin tw sentences tgeter.
            \item mke ne f te sentences dependent n te ter fr  cmplete tugt (mke ne  dependent cluse).
            \item indicte  lgicl reltinsip.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Secnd, yu need t recgnize te subrdintrs wen yu see tem.
\end{enumerte}

\sectin{Run-ns}

Tese re ls clled fused sentences. Yu re mking  run-n wen yu put tw cmplete sentences ( subject nd its predicte nd nter subject nd its predicte) tgeter in ne sentence witut seprting tem prperly. Here's n exmple f  run-n:

\emp{My fvrite Mediterrnen spred is ummus it is very grlicky.}

Tis ne sentence ctully cntins tw cmplete sentences but ws mde int ne incrrect sentence. Luckily, tere re mny wys t crrect tis run-n sentence.
\begin{enumerte}[nsep]
    \item \emp{My fvrite Mediterrnen spred is ummus; it is very grlicky.} [ semicln]
    \item \emp{My fvrite Mediterrnen spred is ummus, fr it is very grlicky.} -OR- \emp{My fvrite Mediterrnen spred is ummus, nd it is very grlicky.} [ cmm nd  crdinting cnjunctin (fr, nd, nr, but, r, yet, s)]
    \item \emp{My fvrite Mediterrnen spred is ummus becuse it is very grlicky.} -OR- \emp{Becuse it is s grlicky, my fvrite Mediterrnen spred is ummus.} [ subrdinting cnjunctin] 
    \item \emp{My fvrite Mediterrnen spred is umus. It is very grlicky.} [tw seprte sentences wit  perid in between]
\end{enumerte}

Yu CANNOT simply dd  cmm between te tw sentences, r yu'll end up wit wt's clled  "cmm splice." Here's n exmple f  cmm splice:

\emp{My fvrite Mediterrnen spred is ummus, it is very grlicky.}

Yu cn fix  cmm splice te sme wy yu fix  run-n -- eiter cnge te punctutin r dd  cnjunctin. Te gd news is tt writers tend t be eiter cmm splicers r run-n rtists, but lmst never bt.

As yu cn see, fixing run-ns is pretty esy nce yu see tem -- but w d yu find ut if  sentence is  run-n if yu ren't sure? Rei R. Nguci, in is bk Grmmr nd te Tecing f Writing, suggests tt yu test yur sentences wit tw metds:
\begin{itemize}[nsep]
    \item Turn tem int yes/n questins.
    \item Turn tem int tg questins (sentences tt end wit  questining prse t te very end).
\end{itemize}

Tese re tw tings tt nerly everyne cn d esily if te sentence is nt  run-n, but tey becme next t impssible if it is. Lk t te fllwing sentence:

\emp{My fvrite Mediterrnen spred is ummus.}

If yu turn it int  questin, it lks like tis:

\emp{Is my fvrite Mediterrnen spred ummus?}

If yu turn it int  tg questin, it lks like tis:

\emp{My fvrite Mediterrnen spred is ummus, isn't it?}

Te first sentence is cmplete nd nt  run-n, becuse ur test wrked. Nw, try te test wit te riginl run-n sentence:

\emp{My fvrite Mediterrnen spred is ummus it is very grlicky.}

Te yes/n questin cn nly be mde wit ec seprte tugt, nt te sentence s  wle:

\emp{Is my fvrite Mediterrnen spred ummus? Is it very grlicky?}

\sectin{Cmprisn nd prllelism}

\prgrp{Cmprisn}
\begin{itemize}[nsep]
    \item Intrduce by generl sttement nd sred cmmn fetures: tell te reder wt {subjects} re being cmpred r cntrsted.  
    \item Trnsitin t difference: estblis te spects f te subjects tt mke tem useful t cmpre r cntrst. (sw w te subjects re {similr r different}). 
    \item Sttement but preferbility by direct r indirect metds: tell te reder wt yu re trying t demnstrte r prve. (yur {purpse} in mking te cmprisn r cntrst). 
\end{itemize} 

Exmple ne: \emp{Pysicl principles lwys ply n imprtnt rle in bilgicl studies}. Surfce plsmn resnnce (SPR) spectrscpy nd plsmn-wveguide resnnce (PWR) spectrscpy re tw cmpelling exmples. \emp{Tey re pticl tecniques wic sre te sme bsis f electrmgnetic teries nd re used t prbe bilgicl events ccurring t te surfce nd interfce f n immbilized smple.} Hwever, te pprtus design nd te mesurement mde f SPR nd PWR re different.   

\prgrp{Prllelism}

Wen yu list tw r mre elements in  sentence r  list, bt grmmr nd style demnd tt tey ll fllw te sme pttern. T mke everyting prllel, cse ne item s  mdel fr ll te ters: "\emp{He ws csen fr is skill nd persnlity}" r "\emp{He ws csen becuse e ws bt skillful nd persnble.}"

Wen yu mke cmprisns, yu need tw prllel items, members f te sme generl fmily. Yu cn n mre sy tt "\emp{Cnd's ppultin is lrger tn Englnd}" tn yu cn "\emp{My jb is n engineer.}" In bt cses, ere, te simplest, fstest slutin is t dd "tt f" (r, wit plurls, "tse f"), tis wy: "\emp{Cnd's ppultin is lrger tn tt f Englnd}" r "\emp{My jb is tt f n engineer}." Mke sure te left side nd rigt side lwys belng t te sme ctegry.
