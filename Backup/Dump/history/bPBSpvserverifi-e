#!/bin/bash

#- start an interactive session on a compute node with salloc
#- the maximum run time of an interactive job is 3 hours.
#- run graphical programs interactively by adding the --x11 flag
#- must first connect with ssh -Y useid@machine_name

#- Step 1: install the same ParaView version as the one on the cluster,
#- and connect the compute node
ssh morui@graham.sharcnet.ca

#- Step 2 option 1: start a serial GPU server
salloc --time=0:30:0 --ntasks=1 --gres=gpu:1 --account=def-fslien
#- load the ParaView GPU+EGL module, change display variable
#- to not use the X11 rendering context, and start the ParaView server
module load paraview-offscreen-gpu/5.4.0
unset DISPLAY
pvserver

#- Step 2 option 2: start a MPI CPU server
salloc --time=0:30:0 --ntasks=4 --account=def-fslien
#-  "--mesa" to enable automatic detection of the best software rendering option.
module load paraview-offscreen/5.4.0
srun pvserver --mesa

#- Step 4: wait for the server to be ready to accept client connection.
#- Make a note of the node and the port and in another terminal on your laptop
#- link the port on your laptop and the same port on the compute node. 
ssh morui@graham.sharcnet.ca -L 11111:gra257:11111

#- Step 5: start ParaView on your laptop, go to File -> Connect -> Add Server ->
#- name = graham, server type = Client/Server, host = localhost, port = 11111,
#- then click Configure -> Manual -> Save -> Connect.

#- Step 6: Open a file in ParaView and visualize it as usual. An important setting in
#- ParaView's preferences is Render View -> Remote/Parallel Rendering Options -> Remote
#- Render Threshold. If set to default (20MB) or similar, small rendering will be done
#- on laptop's GPU, the rotation with a mouse will be fast, but anything modestly
#- intensive (under 20MB) will be shipped to your laptop and visualization might be slow.
#- If set to 0MB, all rendering will be remote including rotation, so you will be really
#- using the cluster's GPU for everything, which is good for large data processing but not
#- so good for interactivity. Experiment with the threshold to find a suitable value.
