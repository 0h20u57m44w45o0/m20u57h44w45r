\subsection{Using Google to search for collocations}

In Google search box, place quotation marks around a phrase that you want to learn to use. For instance, you might want to find ways to use \emph{"In recent years there has been interest in ..."} you might want to know what kind of modifiers can be used before \emph{interest}. Place an asterisk * before \emph{interest}. This search will yield the phrase along with words that come before \emph{interest}. To narrow your search, you can add another topic. For instance, your area may be electric vehicles. Your search would then look something like this.

\emph{"In recent years, there has been * interest in" "electric vehicle"}

To determine how common these adjectives are, you can then search for the complete expressions (e.g., "in recent years there has been increasing interest in ")
