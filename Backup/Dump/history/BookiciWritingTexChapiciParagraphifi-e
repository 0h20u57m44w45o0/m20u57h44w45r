\chapter{Paragraph}

Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. A paragraph is defined as "a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit". The unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea, which is referred to as the "controlling idea", because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.

\section{Development}

Every paragraph in a paper should be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unified: All of the sentences in a single paragraph should be related to a single controlling idea (often expressed in the topic sentence of the paragraph), and the controlling idea should refer to the central idea, or thesis, of the paper.
    \item Coherent: The sentences should be arranged in a logical manner and should follow a definite plan for development.
    \item Well-developed: Every idea discussed in the paragraph should be adequately explained and supported through evidence and details that work together to explain the paragraph's controlling idea.
\end{itemize}

Organize a paragraph. The organization you choose will depend on the controlling idea of the paragraph. Below are a few possibilities for organization:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Narration: Tell a story. Go chronologically, from start to finish.
    \item Description: Provide specific details. Organize spatially, in order of appearance, or by topic.
    \item Process: Explain how something works, step by step. Perhaps follow a sequence -- first, second, third.
    \item Classification: Separate into groups or explain the various parts of a topic.
    \item Illustration: Give examples and explain how those examples prove your point. 
\end{itemize}

5-step process to paragraph development
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Decide on a controlling idea and create a topic sentence}. Paragraph development begins with the formulation of the controlling idea. This idea directs the paragraph's development. Often, the controlling idea of a paragraph will appear in the form of a topic sentence, which is used as an opening statement to guide readers for the rest of the paragraph. In some cases, you may need more than one sentence to express a paragraph's controlling idea.
    \item \emph{Explain the controlling idea}. Paragraph development continues with an expression of the rationale or the explanation that the writer gives for how the reader should interpret the information presented in the idea statement or topic sentence of the paragraph. The writer explains his/her thinking about the main topic, idea, or focus of the paragraph. 
    \item \emph{Give examples}. Paragraph development progresses with the expression of some type of support or evidence for the idea and the explanation that came before it. The example serves as a sign or representation of the relationship established in the idea and explanation portions of the paragraph.
    \item  \emph{Explain the examples}. The next movement in paragraph development is an explanation of each example and its relevance to the topic sentence and rationale that were stated at the beginning of the paragraph. This explanation shows readers why you chose to use this/or these particular examples as evidence to support the major claim, or focus, in your paragraph. Continue the pattern of giving examples and explaining them until all points/examples that the writer deems necessary have been made and explained. NONE of your examples should be left unexplained.
    \item \emph{Complete the paragraph's idea or transition into the next paragraph}. The final movement in paragraph development involves tying up the loose ends of the paragraph and reminding the reader of the relevance of the information in this paragraph to the main or controlling idea of the paper. At this point, you can remind your reader about the relevance of the information that you just discussed in the paragraph. You might feel more comfortable, however, simply transitioning your reader to the next development in the next paragraph.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Transition}

Transitions can help reinforce the underlying logic of your paper's organization by providing the reader with essential information regarding the relationship between your ideas. In this way, transitions act as the glue that binds the components of your argument or discussion into a unified, coherent, and persuasive whole.

\paragraph{Types of transitions}

The types of transitions available to you are as diverse as the circumstances in which you need to use them. A transition can be a single word, a phrase, a sentence, or an entire paragraph. In each case, it functions the same way: first, the transition either directly summarizes the content of a preceding sentence, paragraph, or section or implies such a summary (by reminding the reader of what has come before). Then it helps the reader anticipate or comprehend the new information that you wish to present.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Transitions between sections -- Particularly in longer works, it may be necessary to include transitional paragraphs that summarize for the reader the information just covered and specify the relevance of this information to the discussion in the following section.
    \item Transitions between paragraphs -- If you have done a good job of arranging paragraphs so that the content of one leads logically to the next, the transition will highlight a relationship that already exists by summarizing the previous paragraph and suggesting something of the content of the paragraph that follows. A transition between paragraphs can be a word or two (however, for example, similarly), a phrase, or a sentence. Transitions can be at the end of the first paragraph, at the beginning of the second paragraph, or in both places.
    \item Transitions within paragraphs -- As with transitions between sections and paragraphs, transitions within paragraphs act as cues by helping readers to anticipate what is coming before they read it. Within paragraphs, transitions tend to be single words or short phrases.
\end{itemize}

Make your ideas flow and Keep your readers on track. Good writers use a variety of techniques to create unity and coherence in their paragraphs and sentences.
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Use an "old-to-new" flow of information.
    \item Link by repetition, but don't overdo it.
    \item Use pronouns to link to avoid repetition, but be careful that the reference is clear to your reader. Caution! The pronoun "it" can be very confusing for your readers. Use \emph{Referents(This/These) $+$ a Noun Summary Phrase} instead.
    \item Use synonyms to link.
    \item Make connections with verbs (collocations).
    \item Flow connection and transition: use linking Words and phrases.
    \item Write concisely and trim unnecessary words.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Transitional expressions}

Effectively constructing each transition often depends upon your ability to identify words or phrases that will indicate for the reader the kind of logical relationships you want to convey. Whenever you have trouble finding a word, phrase, or sentence to serve as an effective transition, refer to reference resources.

\section{Paraphrasing}

A paraphrase is a restatement (in your own words) of the ideas in the original source. Good paraphrasing can demonstrate that you have understood the text you have read and can avoid plagiarizing.

\paragraph{Structured paraphrasing procedure}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item Fully understand the original ideas. Identify the important information in the source and the relationship between points.
    \item Replace each part of the original source with corresponding synonyms.
    \item Rewrite the modified sentence by changing the sentence structure, the voice, and/or the word forms.
    \item Revise the paraphrase to outline the main ideas and key supporting details. Improve transition and information flow.
    \item Acknowledge the original source in your paraphrase using citations. Two ways to cite the ideas, evidence, and research of others: i) Research-prominent (non-integral) citations. The information is the subject of the sentence, and the citation follows in parentheses at the end of the sentence. ii) Author-prominent (integral) citations. The name of the authors is the subject of the sentence, and the date of publication is included in parentheses.
\end{enumerate}
