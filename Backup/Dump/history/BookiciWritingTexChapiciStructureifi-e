\chapter{Structure}

An overall picture for doing PhD
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item At the very beginning of PhD, find a dissertation template, and complete the overall structure of the dissertation.
    \item Whenever find good ideas and thoughts, stuff them into the corresponding sections.
    \item Whenever start to develop or implement a method, express the method and its implementation in the dissertation first, continuously improve the expression until all the procedures being full explained and understood, then implement the method, and then iterate between the expression and implementation processes.
\end{enumerate}
An overall picture for doing research
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item Research = idea + validation + delivery (presentation or paper to communicate ideas)
    \item The greatest ideas are (literally) worthless if you keep them to yourself \citep{peyton2004write}.
    \item Goal: to convey your idea from your head to your reader's head; to infect the mind of your reader with your idea, like a virus.
    \item The wrong way to do research: idea $\to$ do research $\to$ write paper.
    \item The correct way to do research: idea $\to$ write paper $\to$ do research.
        \begin{itemize}[nosep]
            \item Write a paper, and give a talk, about any idea, no matter how insignificant it may seem to you.
            \item Writing is the way to rigorously develop the idea in the first place.
            \item Being forced to be clear and focused.
            \item Crystallises unknown and missing aspects.
            \item Papers are like wine: they need time to mature.
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
An overall picture for paper writing
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item Ask what is the most important idea that you want to convey to your reader?
    \item Determine a thesis statement to function like a seed from which your paper and your ideas will grow.
    \item Decompose the paper to: skeleton (structure) $+$ body parts (content) $+$ arteries (delivery and idea flow).
    \item Build a skeleton to support the body of paper: title + abstract + introduction with three moves + method and results with subsection headings + conclusion.
    \item Stuff each body part to convey the main idea through reading literature, extracting useful content, and expressing your own thoughts.
    \item Implant arteries into each body part to smooth the idea flow via reasoning, refining, and making transitions.
    \item Revise the paper to make sure that the whole process is an organic one -- a natural progression from a seed to a full-blown paper where there are direct, familial relationships between all of the ideas in the paper.
\end{enumerate}

Research papers are very much concerned with positioning -- with showing that the studies are relevant and make some new contribution to the field. Introduction and conclusion act as bridges that transport your readers from their own lives into the "place" of your analysis, which needs to be introduced and concluded in a way that makes sense to your reader. Authors shall try to create a strong connection between the introduction and conclusion, and a strong connection between method and results such that every method described is related to some results and all results are related to a method.}

\section{Title}

Although the title comes first in an research paper, it may sometimes be finalized last. A good title should satisfy the following requirements:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item Indicate the topic of the study
    \item Indicate the scope of the study (i.e., neither overstating nor understating its significance)
    \item Be self-explanatory to readers in the chosen area
\end{enumerate}

\section{Abstract}

A coherent abstract can help a manuscript reach the next step of external review. The best approach is an summary abstract via 1) summarizing each section of the paper using one- or two sentences, 2) putting the summaries together, 3) making the ideas flow to well illustrate the background, aim, method, results, and conclusions. It is very important that all the involved methods and results should be arranged to illustrate a single coherent idea rather than to mix several loosely-related ideas.

The results and conclusions should NOT be general statements but should be specific and quantitative findings that clearly show benefits and advantages over existing methods in the literature. General descriptions are weak and vague and can easily be considered as false claims and be ignored by reviewers. All the claims should be specific to the current study and accurately backed up by data, and never over-generalize claims and findings. Avoid using provoking words like novel, powerful, state-of-the-art, and other similar words.

\section{Introduction}

The main purpose of the introduction is to provide the rationale for the paper, moving from a general discussion of the topic to the particular question, issue, or hypothesis being investigated. A secondary purpose is to attract interest in the topic and hence the readers.

\subsection{Why bother writing a good introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item You never get a second chance to make a first impression. The opening paragraph of your paper will provide your readers with their initial impressions of your argument, your writing style, and the overall quality of your work. A vague, disorganized, error-filled, off-the-wall, or boring introduction will probably create a negative impression. On the other hand, a concise, engaging, and well-written introduction will capture your readers' interest and make them join you for an interesting intellectual conversation.

    \item Your introduction is an important road map for the rest of your paper. You can let them know what your topic is, why it is important, and how you plan to proceed with your discussion. In most academic disciplines, your introduction should contain a thesis that will assert your main argument. It should also, ideally, give the reader a sense of the kinds of information you will use to make that argument and the general organization of the paragraphs and pages that will follow. After reading your introduction, your readers should not have any major surprises in store when they read the main body of your paper.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Strategies for writing an effective introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Start by thinking about the question (or questions) you are trying to answer. Your entire essay will be a response to this question, and your introduction is the first step toward that end. 
    \item Decide how general or broad your opening should be. Keep in mind that even a "big picture" opening needs to be clearly related to your topic.
    \item Try writing your introduction last. \emph{The writing process can be an important way to organize your ideas, think through complicated issues, refine your thoughts, and develop a sophisticated argument}. You may don't know what to argue at the beginning of the writing process, and only through writing the paper to discover your main argument. It is perfectly fine to start out thinking that you want to argue a particular point, but wind up arguing something slightly or even dramatically different by the time you've written most of the paper. An introduction written at the beginning of that discovery process will not necessarily reflect what you wind up with at the end. You will need to revise your paper to make sure that the introduction, all of the evidence, and the conclusion reflect the argument you intend. At the end of the writing, you need to make sure that the introduction will match the body of the paper. Always remember that writing is an iterative process between the macroscale (idea) and microscale (logic developments) structures until they are converged.
    \item Open with an attention grabber. Sometimes, especially if the topic of your paper is somewhat dry or technical, opening with something catchy can help.
    \item Pay special attention to your first sentence. Start off on the right foot with your readers by making sure that the first sentence actually says something useful and that it does so in an interesting and error-free way.
    \item Be straightforward and confident. Assert your main argument confidently. After all, you can't expect your reader to believe it if it doesn't sound like you believe it.
\end{itemize}

Introduction of research papers typically follow the rhetorical pattern known as the create-a-research-space (or CARS) model in response to two kinds of competition: competition for readers and competition for research space \citep{swales2004academic}. Moves in research paper introductions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[Move] 1 -- Establish a research territory (what has been done)
        \begin{enumerate}[nosep]
            \item by showing that the general research area is important, central, interesting, problematic, or relevant in some way (optional)
            \item by introducing and reviewing items of previous research in the area (obligatory)
        \end{enumerate}
    \item[Move] 2 -- Establish a niche (a niche is a context where a specific piece of research makes particularly good sense, that is, the motivation for the study)

        by indicating a gap in the previous research or by extending previous knowledge in some way (obligatory)
    \item[Move] 3 -- Occupy the niche (what the present research is about)
        \begin{enumerate}[nosep]
            \item by outlining purposes or stating the nature of the present research (obligatory)
            \item by listing research questions or hypotheses (PISF = probable in some fields, but rare in others)
            \item by announcing principal findings (PISF)
            \item by stating the value of the present research (PISF)
            \item by indicating the structure of the paper (PISF)
        \end{enumerate}
        Reviewers will not even finish reading the paper if there are many things wrong with the paper. For examples, lack of motivation, old and not interesting problem, poor English, the authors showing lack of knowledge, poor methodology, false claims, etc. In order to effectively communicate contributions and let readers clearly see the value of the proposed method and why they should use the method, all the claims should be backed up by quantitative data, analysis, and comparison with existing methods.
        
        Sufficient evidence showing the advantages of the proposed method over existing methods in the literature must be provided. Differences and improvements for methods and results based on previously published ones should be clearly described. The grid convergence of the implementations and results must be demonstrated. Any deficits and weaknesses about the method and results should not be hidden but should be clearly analyzed. Do not over-generalize claims and findings or introduce things that are not studied in the current work.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Literature review}

A literature review is a comprehensive examination of what has been published on a specific topic by the researchers in that field and is usually one of the first steps in research. You write literature reviews to identify trends, gaps, intersections, and directions within published research while also situating your own work within the larger context by explaining how your work grew out of earlier related research and detailing the major developments in your approaches. You use literature reviews to introduce readers to the surrounding literature and also form the basis for understanding the importance of your research.

Conducting a literature review will help you to clarify your understanding of the content, to critically appraise other researchers' work, and to establish a coherent picture of the current body of knowledge, which will organize your thoughts on analyses of your research and streamline your writing process. Writing a literature review requires summarizing, synthesizing, analyzing, and evaluating.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{review_skill}
    \caption{Analytical skills for literature review.}
    \label{fig:review_skill}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Format Variations}

\emph{Stand-alone literature reviews} are self-contained pieces of writing that can summarize and synthesize previously published studies on a specific topic to outline existing evidence, to identify gaps in current research, and to position future research. Once researchers have selected a topic, the first step in their research methodology is often the stand-alone literature review. \emph{Embedded literature reviews} are part of a larger piece of writing, such as an essay, thesis, or scholarly article, for discussing and analyzing published material related to the research topic. They introduce readers to the surrounding literature while also situating your work within the larger scholarly discussion on that topic. You make clear what is your work about and then explain chronologically and thematically the important finds that preceded and motivated your research. You show links between studies. This tightly argued section forms the basis for understanding the importance of your research.

\paragraph{Writing steps}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pre-writing
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \emph{Planning}: Construct a research question to direct your research and reading strategies. From here, identify the purpose or thesis for your topic.
            \item \emph{Searching}: Determine keywords and carefully select sources that will provide current and credible information on your topic.
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item First, use an academic search engine such as Google Scholar and some well-chosen keywords to find three to five \emph{recent highly-cited} papers in the area (sort by citation to evaluate quality and sort by date to track the research trends). For a complete new topic, may use Wikipedia and its reference list to find relevant papers. Do one-pass read on each paper to get a sense of the work, then read their introduction sections. You will find a thumbnail summary of the recent work, and perhaps, if you are lucky, a pointer to a recent survey paper. If you can find such a survey, you are done. Read the survey, congratulating yourself on your good luck.
                    \item Otherwise, in the second step of the three-pass approach, find shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliography, or check highly-cited papers in the citation links of the paper provided by the search engine. These are the key papers and researchers in that area. Download the key papers and set them aside. Then go to the websites of the key researchers and see where they've published recently. That will help you identify the top journals in that field.
                    \item The third step is to use search engine to search the keywords together with each top journal name to identify recent high-quality related work. These papers, along with the ones you set aside earlier, constitute the first version of your survey. Make two passes through these papers. If they all cite a key paper that you did not find earlier, obtain and read it, iterating as necessary.
                \end{enumerate}
            \item \emph{Reading}: Literature reviews require a substantial amount of reading, so approaching each source methodically results in a thorough understanding of the content and saves time. One strategy for active reading is to use the three-pass method \citep{keshav2007read} to break your reading into three steps that collectively allow you to quickly examine all aspects of each source.
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item First pass (quick scan to get a general idea about the paper and decide if you need to read again): carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction $\to$ read the headings but ignore everything else $\to$ glance figures and equations to determine the underlying theoretical foundations $\to$ read the conclusions $\to$ glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you've already read $\to$ determine the five Cs: Category, the source type such as empirical, theoretical, qualitative; Context, related papers and theories; Correctness, do the assumptions appear to be valid? Contributions, the paper's main contributions; Clarity, is the paper well written? Decide if you will use the source and read again.

                        The first pass is adequate for papers that aren't in your research area, but may someday prove relevant. Incidentally, when you write a paper, you can expect most reviewers (and readers) to make only one pass over it. Take care to choose coherent section and sub-section titles and to write concise and comprehensive abstracts, introduction, and conclusions. If a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will likely be rejected; if a reader cannot understand the highlights of the paper after five minutes, the paper will likely never be read.

                    \item Second pass (grasp the content but not its details such as proofs): Underline main ideas/thesis/research questions. Make diagrams, flow charts, or outlines to represent main ideas of paragraphs. Summarize main idea of paragraphs in your own words using one sentence. Identify confusing sections and record relevant unread references to return to after further reading. Summarize main findings. Determine the significance of conclusions. In the introduction section of your own paper, write an overall summary of the source to record author's thesis, methodology, strengths, limitations, and significant findings in addition to your evaluation and suggestions. In the reading process, extract useful content and stuff into the related parts of your own paper.
                    \item Third pass (final read to fully understand assumptions and validity of conclusions): Identify and challenge every assumption and conclusion made by the authors. Reconstruct the study as if you were the researcher to identify not only the paper's innovations, but also its hidden failings and assumptions. Identify strengths and weaknesses of ideas. Consider what you would do differently as the researcher. Record ideas for future work. In the introduction of your own paper, refine the overall summary of the source to reflect what the paper is about, the main findings, and your evaluation of the paper, as if describing it to a friend, since the best way to understand something is to explain it to others. Review your summary to ensure you have not missed valuable information.
                \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Drafting
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \emph{Analyzing}: Critically review each source's methods, procedures, data validity/reliability, and other themes of interest. Sources can be organized chronologically or thematically. Organizing your literature review according to themes, methodologies, and underlying concepts is more effective than listing each source one by one, as it demonstrates your mastery of the topic and provides readers with a better sense of the state of research in that field. Consider how each source approaches your topic in addition to their collective points of intersection and separation. Identify any gaps within their research. Try to place your current work and research within this wider discussion by considering how your research supports, contradicts, or departs from other scholars' research. The key point about literature reviews is that they should clearly show an organizing mind at work rather than simple undigested lists of what has been done.

                Critique and evaluation:
                \begin{itemize}[nosep]
                    \item \textbf{Must be $100\%$ correct, fair, and reasonable}. \textbf{Never give a judge without a thorough understanding of the work}, and more importantly, \textbf{never give a negative judge}. Otherwise, you will shoot your own foot by offending the reviewers.
                    \item Use the sandwich method: begin the critique with positive compliments, then followed by constructive comments to implicitly convey the limitations (\textbf{be brief yet clear and helpful}), then ended by encouraging suggestions or wishes.
                    \item \textbf{Be extremely cautious of evaluative language when commenting or referring others' work, especially when stating the limitations of others or comparing yours with others.} Never use vague descriptions or direct comparisons to state your contributions. See the example below:
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item Bad critique: "Compared with models based on experimental correlations [1] or short-range repulsive-force collisions [2], an interface-resolved collision model can enhance the physical representation of the practical problems."

                                Direct comparison is dangerous and easy to shoot your own foot! The "enhance the physical representation" is vague and unclear. Should specifically tell why and how. Should never leave the questions and reasoning process to readers. If you ask them to interpret, they will always interpret yours as wrong!
                            \item Better critique: "Models based on experimental correlations [1] often have limited description for flow with dense-to-dilute transitions. Short-range repulsive-force collisions [2] usually only consider the position of solids and omit size and shape effects. An interface-resolved collision model can provide a more comprehensive description of collision dynamics and thus a wider applicability."
                        \end{itemize}
                    \item Use hedging to soften opinions.
                    \item Use past unreal conditions (\emph{could have done} or \emph{would have been more ... if had done ...}) to express criticism regarding what the author should have done but did not do.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \emph{Synthesizing}: Synthesizing findings across studies and make conclusions based on the collective evidence.
            \item \emph{Discussing}: Briefly explain the current state of research about your topic. Use specific authors or sources as examples, and be sure to explain any similarities or departures in approach, methodology, findings, or argument. Then, explain where your research fits within this discussion and why your work is useful.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Revising
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \emph{Revising}: Revise and finalize the structure, style, information flow, and grammar, etc. 
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Method}

Describes, in various degree of detail, methodology, materials (or subject), and procedures. This is the narrowest part of the research paper. You should make sure that every method described is related to some results and all results are related to a method.

A good methodology leads to the expectation that the results will also be good. "If an abstract is of interest, the editor next looks at the methods section of the manuscript before deciding whether to reject the paper or pass it on to the screening editor on duty for that day. The screen editor decides whether the manuscript should be sent for external review" -- E. Langdon-Neuner

For any reused methods part, try to paraphrase the descriptions without copy verbatim. In general, copying text even from one of your own previously published articles without citing the source is a breach of publication ethics as this amounts to self-plagiarism. Similar to plagiarism of another person's work, self-plagiarism too, if detected after publication, could lead to retraction. Editors very rarely rely solely on plagiarism detection software to give a manuscript a verdict of plagiarism. Editors consider the software results but largely use their own judgement as well. Editors tend to be more tolerant of textual similarities in the methods section, because most original studies use previously described methods. However, the consensus is that it is still essential to cite the source article in which the methods were first described. This applies even to commonly used methods.

Authors who submit a manuscript for publication containing data, reviews, conclusions, etc., that have already been disseminated in some significant manner (e.g., published as an article in another journal, presented at a conference, posted on the internet) must clearly indicate to the editors and readers the nature of the previous dissemination.

If you are submitting two manuscripts based on the same method, here's what you need to do to safeguard yourself against self-plagiarism:

1. Be sure that the studies are distinct enough to warrant two separate publications without being considered a case of salami slicing.

2. Ensure that both your manuscripts cite the original study that first described the said method (here, I assume that the method itself has not been devised by you and has been described previously).

3. Inform the editor in the cover letter that the content duplication in the methods section is intentional as you have replicated a previously published method.

4. If one manuscript gets published earlier than the other, the second manuscript should cite the first and indicate that the methods have been previously described in one of your own papers.

5. If both manuscripts are submitted around the same time, the cover letter for each should disclose that another study conducted using the same method is under consideration by another journal.

6. The manuscript must go through plagiarism check first before submission.

\section{Results}

The findings are described, accompanied by strong and logical analysis and interpretations. If there are any drawbacks or insufficiency in the methods for obtaining results, must do not hide but should clearly discuss the related issues, potential causes, and influences. Every test case and result presented should be interpreted, connected, and concluded clearly. Never let impatience take over and let the reviewers or readers do the interpretation. Otherwise, things will definitely go to the wrong direction and cost a lot from that impatience and laziness.

\section{Conclusion}

Gives meaning to and interprets the results in a variety of ways. Make a series of salient "points", at least some of which refer to statements made in the introduction. The structure of discussion/conclusion sections:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item[Move] 1 -- Providing background information (research purposes, theory, methodology) to contextualize the study and, in doing so, to consolidate the research space.
    \item[Move] 2 -- Summarizing and reporting key results
    \item[Move] 3 -- Commenting on the key results (making claims backed up by quantitative data, analysis, and comparison with existing methods, explaining the results, comparing the new work with the previous studies, offering alternative explanations, stating significance for the field of study)
    \item[Move] 4 -- May consider making recommendations for future implementation and/or for future research.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Revision}

After finishing the paper, it is recommended to complete the following tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{A significance and novelty statement}: A condensed introduction to describe what your research is adding to the existing literature. This short statement should address the novelty aspect and the significance of the work with respect to the existing literature and more generally to the society. This statement should be written to a broad audience, at an undergraduate level, and limited to 120 words.

        Example:
        \lstinputlisting[language=Tex]{Src/Significance_and_Novelty.txt}

    \item \emph{Highlights}: A short collection of bullet points that convey the core findings of the article. Please use 'Highlights' in the file name and include 3 to 5 bullet points (maximum 85 characters, including spaces, per bullet point).

        Example:
        \lstinputlisting[language=Tex]{Src/Highlights.txt}

    \item \emph{Cover letter}: Craft a well-written cover letter that highlights the significance and novelty of the research as well as provides a good reason why the manuscript is a good fit for the journal.
        \begin{enumerate}[nosep]
            \item Check whether the journal's "Instructions for Authors" have any cover letter requirements (e.g. disclosures, statements, potential reviewers).
            \item Write a letter that explains why the editor would want to publish your manuscript:
                \begin{enumerate}[nosep]
                    \item If known, address the editor who will be assessing your manuscript by name. Include the date of submission and the journal you are submitting to.
                    \item First paragraph: Include the title and the type of manuscript (review, original article).
                    \item Second paragraph: Briefly explain the background of the study, the research question sought out to answer and why. Should concisely explain what was done, the main findings and why they are significant.
                    \item Third paragraph: Indicate why the readers of the journal would be interested in the work. Take cues from the journal's aims and scope. For example, if the journal requires that all work published has broad implications, explain how your study fulfils this. It is also a good idea to include a sentence on the importance of the results to the field. At last, state any journal specific requirements that need to be complied with (e.g. ethical standards). All cover letters should contain these sentences: We confirm that this manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal. All authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission to [insert the name of the target journal].
                \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}

        Example:
        \lstinputlisting[language=Tex]{Src/Cover_Letter.txt}

    \item Prepare slides about the ideas and methods of the paper, give a presentation to colleagues, and solicit advice. After revising the paper, put the paper aside for a couple of days or even longer, then reexamine the entire paper. The most critical aspect of revision is that all comments should be valued and addressed point by point with quantitative data and analysis.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Responding to the reviewer}

You may not be able to control what the reviewers write in their review comments, but you can control the way you react to their comments. It's useful to remember these points:

\paragraph{Reviewers have, on the whole, given time and effort to constructively criticize your article}

Reviewers are volunteers and have given up their own time to evaluate your paper in order to contribute to the research community. Reviewers very rarely receive formal compensation beyond recognition from the editors of the effort they have expended. The author will get the ultimate credit, but reviewers are often key contributors to the shape of the final paper. Although the comments you receive may feel harsh, most reviewers are also authors and therefore will be trying to highlight how the paper could be improved. So, it is important to be grateful for the time that both reviewers and editors have spent evaluating your paper – and to express this gratitude in your response.

\paragraph{The importance of good manners}

You should remain polite and thoughtful throughout any and all response to reviewers and editors. You are much more likely to receive a positive response in return and this will help build a constructive relationship with both reviewer and editor in the future.

\paragraph{Don't take criticism as a personal attack}

As stated previously, it is very rare that a paper will be accepted without any form of revisions requested. It is the job of the editor and reviewer to make sure that the published papers are scientifically sound, factual, clear and complete. In order to achieve this, it will be necessary to draw attention to areas of improvement. While this may be difficult for you as an author, the criticism received is not intended to be personal.

\paragraph{Avoid personalizing responses to the reviewer}

Sticking to the facts and avoiding personal attacks is imperative. It's a good idea to wait 24 to 72 hours before responding to a decision letter, then re-read the email. This simple process will remove much of the personal bias that could pollute appeals letters written in rage or disappointment. If you respond in anger, or in an argumentative fashion the editor and reviewers are much less likely to respond favorably.

Remember, even if you think the reviewer is wrong, this doesn't necessarily mean that you are right! It is possible that the reviewer has made a mistake, but it is also possible that the reviewer was not able to understand your point because of a lack of clarity, or omission of crucial detail in your paper.

\paragraph{Evaluating the reviewer comments and planning your response}

After you have read the decision letter and the reviewers comments, wait for at least 24 hours, then take a fresh look at the comments provided. This will help to neutralize the initial emotional response you may have and allow you to determine what the reviewers are asking for in a more objective manner.

Spending time assessing the scope of the revisions requested will help you evaluate the extent of effort required and prioritize the work you may need to undertake. It will also help you to provide a comprehensive response in your letter of reply.

Some useful steps to consider:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Make a list of all the reviewer comments and number them.
    \item Categorize the list as follows:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item     requests for clarification of existing text, addition of text to fill a gap in the paper, or additional experimental details
            \item     requests to reanalyze, re-express, or reinterpret existing data.
            \item     requests for additional experiments or further proof of concept.
            \item     requests you simply cannot meet.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Note down the action/response that you plan to undertake for each comment. If there are requests that you cannot meet, you need to address these in your response – providing a logical, reasoned explanation for why the study is not detrimentally affected by not making the changes requested.
    \item To let reviewers clearly see the validity of the response, all the arguments and claims in the paper as well as in the author's response should be backed up by quantitative data and analysis, avoiding only use abstract and qualitative description.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{How to address reviewers' comments}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answering politely.} Never being insulting to the reviewers, the editor or the journal publishers; it is pointless and unlikely to advance your case for publication.  Editors do their best to discourage inappropriate comments by reviewers and to edit out any that they may make. If any of these to filter through to you then do not 'rise to the bait' and reply in kind; stick to the point that is being raised.
    \item \textbf{Answering completely.} Means two things: responding to all the points that are raised; and responding to each of the points as thoroughly as you can.  Your 'default' setting ought to be a willingness to make any necessary changes but if there are contradictory points between reviewers and/or a reviewer has actually misunderstood you or is patently wrong, then these points still need to be addressed. The worst mistake you can make is to ignore a point. And, if you are pointing out an error or a misunderstanding, then refer to the point above about being polite.
    \item \textbf{Answering with evidence.} Where you disagree with a reviewer you must support that with evidence and the best way to do this - provided the evidence is correct - is to reference other published work supporting your point.
    \item \textbf{Answering with positivity.} Be optimistic and proceed with the belief that if you address the points adequately, then you are very likely to be accepted and published.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What to do if your manuscript gets rejected}

It is very common for papers to be rejected. Studies indicate that $21\%$ of papers are rejected without review, and approximately $40\%$ of papers are rejected after peer review.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If your paper has been rejected prior to peer review due to lack of subject fit, then find a new journal to submit your work to and move on.
    \item If you receive a rejection after your paper has been reviewed, you will have a rich source of information about possible improvements that you could make. You should make changes and submit to a different journal.

        If you decide to try a different journal, you should still carefully consider the comments you received during the first round of review, and work on improving your manuscript before submitting elsewhere. Make sure that you adjust details like the cover letter, referencing and any other journal specific details before submitting to a different journal.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Ethical responsibilities of authors, Springer}

Authors should refrain from misrepresenting research results which could damage the trust in the journal, the professionalism of scientific authorship, and ultimately the entire scientific endeavour. Maintaining integrity of the research and its presentation can be achieved by following the rules of good scientific practice, which include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The manuscript has not been submitted to more than one journal for simultaneous consideration.
    \item The manuscript has not been published previously (partly or in full), unless the new work concerns an expansion of previous work (please provide transparency on the re-use of material to avoid the hint of text-recycling ("self-plagiarism")).
    \item A single study is not split up into several parts to increase the quantity of submissions and submitted to various journals or to one journal over time (e.g. "salami-publishing").
    \item No data have been fabricated or manipulated (including images) to support your conclusions.
    \item No data, text, or theories by others are presented as if they were the author's own ("plagiarism"). Proper acknowledgements to other works must be given (this includes material that is closely copied (near verbatim), summarized and/or paraphrased), quotation marks are used for verbatim copying of material, and permissions are secured for material that is copyrighted.
    \item Consent to submit has been received explicitly from all co-authors, as well as from the responsible authorities - tacitly or explicitly - at the institute/organization where the work has been carried out, before the work is submitted.
    \item Authors whose names appear on the submission have contributed sufficiently to the scientific work and therefore share collective responsibility and accountability for the results.
    \item Upon request authors should be prepared to send relevant documentation or data in order to verify the validity of the results. This could be in the form of raw data, samples, records, etc. Sensitive information in the form of confidential proprietary data is excluded.
\end{itemize}
