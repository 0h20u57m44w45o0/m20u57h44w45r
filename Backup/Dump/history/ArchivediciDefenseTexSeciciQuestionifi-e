%-                           How to Communicate
%-
%- * Think about the purpose when others ask a question: 1) is he/she doesn't know
%-   about it and then ask; 2) is an open question leading to another big question?
%-   3) is he/she knows it but to examine my knowledge? Different stances should be
%-   answered with different approaches.
%-
%- * Think in other's position: when others give opinions or suggestions, don't try 
%-   to defend yourself first, but to change position and defend for others first.
%-   Learn to let go as long as without touching principles and bottom lines.
%-   Don't always try to defend yourself or convince others for every criticism you 
%-   got even if you are correct.
%-
%- * Think about the possibility of miscommunication: miscommunication is always
%-   possible whenever thoughts are not clear and organized. So think before answer.
%-
%-                       Common Defense Questions to Expect
%-
%- * "I collected questions from a bunch of different places which I then tailored
%-   to my PhD. Somebody I worked with also recommended that I put together my 10 
%-   nightmare questions. I found this really useful. By writing down and thinking
%-   about my dreaded questions, they were no longer so bad -- it was almost as if 
%-   I'd faced the beast." Richard Budd, University of Bristol.
%-
%- * "Think the defense as a meeting with people who want to understand your project
%-   and its contribution. For the question-and-answer portion that follows the 
%-   presentation, you should be primed to answer questions about your methodology, 
%-   to defend and explain your choice of analysis, and discuss how your study 
%-   contributes to the literature and where the research might go next" Chamberlin.
%-
%-                      Strategies for Answering Questions
%-
%- * Begin with a "constructive" attitude.
%-
%- * Anticipate the questions likely to be asked: Academics like to apply their own
%-   approaches, frameworks, or research interest to other scholars' work. Become
%-   familiar with the work of your examination committee. Re-read your thesis with
%-   a critical eye to find the weaknesses, gaps, and claims that might inspire 
%-   questions. Be familiar with the questions that are commonly asked during a defense.
%-   
%- * When asking/answering questions, 1) honor the answer/question, 2) repeat/rephrase to
%-   the entire audience, 3) answer and conclude the asking/answering process.
%-
%- * Answer a question properly is a three-step process: 1) Listen to the question carefully.
%-   Too often, you stop listening halfway through because you believe you know what the
%-   question is about, or you are so nervous you start preparing the answer in your head
%-   while the question is still being asked. But sometimes the real question comes only
%-   at the very end of a long expose (in which the examiner may be trying to show off),
%-   and it may not be the question you anticipate. So listen attentively the whole time
%-   the examiner is peaking. 2) Begin your answer by rephrasing the question succinctly
%-   and politely: "Professor Smith, your question on the research described in Chapter 4
%-   addresses enzymatic degradation from an interesting perspective. If I understand your
%-   query correctly, you wonder why ..." This rephrasing establishes whether you have
%-   understood the question properly, and it gives you a moment to collect your thoughts
%-   and prepare the best possible answer. 3) Answer and conclude the question. This might
%-   seem obvious, but too often you will make no serious attempt to answer the question
%-   properly, launching instead into a related or unrelated tangent or long-winded
%-   explication that -- it is hoped -- seems like an answer but isn't. After answering,
%-   if you are unsure: "Did I answer your question?" If a question stumps you, ask the
%-   questioner to repeat the question; rephrase or repeat the question yourself so you
%-   know that is being asked; you do not have to entirely commit to an answer, attempt
%-   to answer the question in a way that at least lets your audience see you thought 
%-   process; if you really do not know, do not fake it.
%-
%- * Sample scripts:
%-   - You asked me (repeat the question), and I'm not sure, but I think...
%-   - The justification of why you do that: tell how others are not adequate and 
%-     the current way suits the needs.
%-   - Given the constraints I was working with, this is what I was able to do.
%-   - I don't know, but that question has interesting implications. For example,
%-     if I knew that I could...
%-   - This question has taught me about X. Next time I would do Y this way.
%-   - I agree with you that X, but, Y.

    %- Identify 5 toughest questions an audience member could ask you.
    \note{
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Why choose a mesoscale discrete model rather than a macroscale continuum model for the dense particles?

                It is very true that macroscale continuum models are popularly used for describing the statistical behavior of dense particles. However, in studying the particle jetting formation, granular scale inhomogeneities and effects such as interfacial drags and collisions are very crucial. Therefore, comparing to macroscale and microscale approaches, a mesoscale model that resolves the interfaces and hence the coupled shock-shock, shock-particle, and particle-particle interactions may lead to a deeper understanding of the phenomenon while being feasible.

            \item How do you justify the effectiveness of the mesoscale results on study a macroscale phenomenon?

                The inclusion of particle additives leads to coupled mesoscale interactions among shock waves and solid particles, producing pressure fluctuations and transverse waves. Under high rates of compaction, momentum and energy transfer, mesoscale interactions are effectively enhanced and later are manifested via complex macroscale jetting phenomena. Therefore, mesoscale interactions are closely associated with the macroscale jets developed at a later time. Althoug the current mesoscale results are limited too a small set of particles, they are still effective in illustrating the jet formation process.

            \item What's the influence of the collision model on particle jetting behavior?

            \item Should particle deformation and fragmentation be considered in the model?

            \item Why do you use the word multimatrial rather than multiphase?

                Multiphase modeling ususally refers to continuum models. Therefore, multimaterial is used here.
            
            \item The perfect gas law is no longer valid for the pressure range?
        \end{enumerate}
