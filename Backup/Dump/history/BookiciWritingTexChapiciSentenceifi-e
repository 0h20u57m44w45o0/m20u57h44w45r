\chapter{Sentence}

The essential elements of a sentence:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item A main clause with a subject, a predicate(verb), and a complete thought.
    \item Time and number: agreement between subject and verb.
    \item Avoid sentence fragments and run-ons.
    \item Sentence connection of independent and dependent clauses.
    \item Punctuation and capitalization.
    \item Formal and informal.
\end{itemize}

\section{Structure}

Clauses of different types can combine to form four types of sentences in English writing. Good writers use a variety of sentence types at varying lengths to make their writing more interesting and dynamic. Remember to use proper punctuation and a variety of connectors to make logical connections both within and between sentences.

A simple sentence is composed of a single independent clause and no dependent clauses.
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \emph{We had a great visit to Paris and Berlin last September.}
    \item \emph{I am currently working on cancer therapy, especially chemotherapy.}
    \item \emph{My area of interest is civil engineering.}
\end{itemize}

A compound sentence is composed of two or more independent clauses which may be connected by a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so, FANBOYS), a semicolon alone, or a semicolon and a conjunctive adverb (also called transition).
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \emph{We visited Paris last September, but my sister visited Paris last summer.}
    \item \emph{Most people enjoy visiting European cities; a few do not.}
    \item \emph{Most people enjoy visiting European cities; however, a few do not.}
    \item \emph{I began to read more and more in this field, and everyday, my interest in this field began to increase and increase.}
\end{itemize}

A complex sentence is composed of one independent clause (the main clause) and one or more dependent clauses.
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \emph{While we were walking through the Louvre, we suddenly met our neighbor John and his family.} [dependent adverb clause starting with while; independent clause starting with we]
    \item \emph{While we were walking through the Louvre, which is one of the most famous museums in the world, we suddenly met our neighbor John and his family, who were also on vacation in Paris.} [dependent adverb clause starting with while; dependent adjective clause starting with which; independent clause starting with we; dependent adjective clause starting with who]
    \item \emph{That I felt so passionate about this topic surprised me.} [noun clause as subject]
\end{itemize}

A compound-complex sentence combines a compound sentence with a complex sentence. It contains two or more independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \emph{While we were walking through the Louvre, which is one of the most famous museums in the world, we suddenly met our neighbor John with his family, and all of us went out for lunch at a splendid bistro.} [dependent adverb clause starting with while; independent clause starting with we; independent clause starting with all of us]
    \item \emph{While we were walking through the Louvre, we suddenly met our neighbor John with his family, and all of us went out for lunch at a splendid bistro, located in a narrow street on the smaller island in the river Seine.} [dependent adverb clause starting with while; independent clause starting with we; independent clause starting with all of us; dependent reduced adjective clause starting with located]
\end{itemize}

Watch out:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Remember to use a comma before a coordinating conjunction which connects two independent clauses.
    \item Use semicolons between independent clauses which themselves contain commas or are very long.
\end{itemize}

Sentence structure rules are the basic building blocks of writing. If you know the basics, you will be able to make your writing more complex as you advance your writing skills.

\section{Fragments}

Recognize the difference between a {sentence} and a {fragment}: A fragment resembles a sentence in a number of ways. Both are groups of words that begin with a capital letter and conclude with an end mark. The one important difference is that a fragment does not contain a {main clause}. Like an engine, the main clause powers a complete sentence, propelling the reader through the development of an idea. A fragment, missing this essential component, stalls on the page.

When you analyze a group of words looking for the {main clause}, you have to find three things: {a subject}, {a verb}, and {a complete thought}. If one of these three items is missing, a fragment results.

Here are examples of fragments:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \emph{And yawned loudly enough to make everyone in class turn around.} [subject $=$ $\Phi$ ; verb $=$ yawned; complete thought $=$ $\Phi$]
    \item \emph{The boy sitting on the fire escape dropping water balloons on the pedestrians below.} [subject $=$ boy; verb $=$ $\Phi$; complete thought $=$ $\Phi$]
    \item \emph{After Gabriel ate half a box of Devil Dogs.} [subject $=$ Gabriel; verb $=$ ate; complete thought $=$ $\Phi$]
\end{itemize}

Groups of words may seem to be sentences because they contain subject and verb-type words, but {beware of incomplete thoughts.} A sentence fragment is an incomplete sentence. Some fragments are incomplete because they lack either a subject or a verb, or both. The fragments that most students have trouble with, however, are dependent clauses -- they have a subject and a verb, so they look like complete sentences, but they don't express a complete thought. They're called "dependent" because they can't stand on their own. If you know something about subordinating conjunctions, you can probably eliminate $90\%$ of your fragments.
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item First, you need to know that subordinating conjunctions do three things.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item join two sentences together.
            \item make one of the sentences dependent on the other for a complete thought (make one a dependent clause).
            \item indicate a logical relationship.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Second, you need to recognize the subordinators when you see them.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Run-ons}

These are also called fused sentences. You are making a run-on when you put two complete sentences (a subject and its predicate and another subject and its predicate) together in one sentence without separating them properly. Here's an example of a run-on:

\emph{My favorite Mediterranean spread is hummus it is very garlicky.}

This one sentence actually contains two complete sentences but was made into one incorrect sentence. Luckily, there are many ways to correct this run-on sentence.
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item \emph{My favorite Mediterranean spread is hummus; it is very garlicky.} [a semicolon]
    \item \emph{My favorite Mediterranean spread is hummus, for it is very garlicky.} -OR- \emph{My favorite Mediterranean spread is hummus, and it is very garlicky.} [a comma and a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so)]
    \item \emph{My favorite Mediterranean spread is hummus because it is very garlicky.} -OR- \emph{Because it is so garlicky, my favorite Mediterranean spread is hummus.} [a subordinating conjunction] 
    \item \emph{My favorite Mediterranean spread is humus. It is very garlicky.} [two separate sentences with a period in between]
\end{enumerate}

You CANNOT simply add a comma between the two sentences, or you'll end up with what's called a "comma splice." Here's an example of a comma splice:

\emph{My favorite Mediterranean spread is hummus, it is very garlicky.}

You can fix a comma splice the same way you fix a run-on -- either change the punctuation or add a conjunction. The good news is that writers tend to be either comma splicers or run-on artists, but almost never both.

As you can see, fixing run-ons is pretty easy once you see them -- but how do you find out if a sentence is a run-on if you aren't sure? Rei R. Noguchi, in his book Grammar and the Teaching of Writing, suggests that you test your sentences with two methods:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Turn them into yes/no questions.
    \item Turn them into tag questions (sentences that end with a questioning phrase at the very end).
\end{itemize}

These are two things that nearly everyone can do easily if the sentence is not a run-on, but they become next to impossible if it is. Look at the following sentence:

\emph{My favorite Mediterranean spread is hummus.}

If you turn it into a question, it looks like this:

\emph{Is my favorite Mediterranean spread hummus?}

If you turn it into a tag question, it looks like this:

\emph{My favorite Mediterranean spread is hummus, isn't it?}

The first sentence is complete and not a run-on, because our test worked. Now, try the test with the original run-on sentence:

\emph{My favorite Mediterranean spread is hummus it is very garlicky.}

The yes/no question can only be made with each separate thought, not the sentence as a whole:

\emph{Is my favorite Mediterranean spread hummus? Is it very garlicky?}

\section{Comparison and parallelism}

\paragraph{Comparison}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Introduce by general statement and shared common features: tell the reader what {subjects} are being compared or contrasted.  
    \item Transition to difference: establish the aspects of the subjects that make them useful to compare or contrast. (show how the subjects are {similar or different}). 
    \item Statement about preferability by direct or indirect methods: tell the reader what you are trying to demonstrate or prove. (your {purpose} in making the comparison or contrast). 
\end{itemize} 

Example one: \emph{Physical principles always play an important role in biological studies}. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy and plasmon-waveguide resonance (PWR) spectroscopy are two compelling examples. \emph{They are optical techniques which share the same basis of electromagnetic theories and are used to probe biological events occurring at the surface and interface of an immobilized sample.} However, the apparatus design and the measurement mode of SPR and PWR are different.   

\paragraph{Parallelism}

When you list two or more elements in a sentence or a list, both grammar and style demand that they all follow the same pattern. To make everything parallel, choose one item as a model for all the others: "\emph{He was chosen for his skill and personality}" or "\emph{He was chosen because he was both skillful and personable.}"

When you make comparisons, you need two parallel items, members of the same general family. You can no more say that "\emph{Canada's population is larger than England}" than you can "\emph{My job is an engineer.}" In both cases, here, the simplest, fastest solution is to add "that of" (or, with plurals, "those of"), this way: "\emph{Canada's population is larger than that of England}" or "\emph{My job is that of an engineer}." Make sure the left side and right side always belong to the same category.
