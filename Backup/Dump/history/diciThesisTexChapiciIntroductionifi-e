\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}

In many physical problems, such as explosions with explosive charges surrounded by or mixed with solid particles \citep{zhang2001explosive, frost2012particle}, pulse detonation propulsion \citep{roy2004pulse}, explosive volcanic eruption \citep{kedrinskiy2009hydrodynamic}, near-surface landmine explosion \citep{rigby2016measuring, rigby2018influence}, impact crater formation \citep{royer2005formation}, and supernova explosion \citep{burrows2000supernova}, the impulsive dispersal of granular materials commonly occurs and exhibits interesting particle clustering and jetting behaviors. In particular, when granular materials are explosively dispersed \citep{zhang2001explosive, frost2012particle}, mesoscale perturbations develop within and at the surface of the granular cloud at a timescale of shock propagating through the payload, frequently leading to the formation of macroscale coherent particle clustering and jetting structures with a dual hierarchy at a later time. Influencing the mass concentration and related particle reaction and energy release, this particle clustering and jetting phenomenon is of considerable interest to study instability and mixing in high-speed gas-solid flows. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear and can be largely inhibited by the complex mesoscale multiphase interactions involved in the dispersal process.

\section{Particle clustering and jetting phenomenon}

The presence of granular scales and the rapid release of intensive driving energy are common characteristics for the formation of coherent particle clustering and jetting structures in different particle dispersal processes. Nonetheless, an explosive dispersal can involve additional features related to detonation and shock waves.

\subsection{Homogeneous detonation}

Consisting of fuel and oxidizer premixed on molecular level, explosives are energetic materials that can rapidly release the contained chemical energy through combustion. Depending on the reaction rate, combustion in explosives can happen in the form of either deflagration or detonation. In deflagration, exothermic chemical reactions occur at the material surface, and thermal conduction transfers the released heat to an adjacent unreacted layer for future ignition. Compared to deflagration that is a subsonic layer-by-layer decomposition, detonation is a supersonic combustion involving a closely coupled leading shock wave and exothermic reaction zone propagating through the material \citep{fickett1979detonation}. Attaining a higher energy release rate, detonation is the primary reaction form of high explosives \citep{bdzil2003high}.

The simplest model of detonation is based on the Chapman--Jouguet (CJ) detonation theory, which treats a detonation wave as a jump discontinuity separating an upstream state and a downstream thermochemical equilibrium state. The reaction zone is assumed to be infinitesimally thin and has an infinite chemical reaction rate. As a jump discontinuity, the flow crossing the detonation wave satisfies the Rankine--Hugoniot conditions, which represent the integral conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy.

A more physical interpretation of detonation is the Zel'dovich--von Neumann--Doering (ZND) model. As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:znd_model_demo}, the ZND model represents a detonation wave as a shock discontinuity followed by a finite length reaction zone. The reaction zone has a finite chemical reaction rate and terminates with the CJ equilibrium state known as the sonic plane. In the reference frame attached to the leading shock, the flow in the reaction zone is steady. Therefore, the shock and the reaction zone propagate together with a constant velocity referred to as the detonation velocity $V_{\Des{D}}$. The flow following the CJ state is a time-dependent rarefaction wave.

    \label{fig:znd_model_demo}
\end{figure}

The structure of a self-sustaining detonation in explosives is further depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:detonation_reaction_zone}. During a detonation process, the supersonic shock front instantly compresses the explosives into a high-pressure and high-temperature state known as the von Neumann spike and initiates explosives into chemical reaction, in which the main energy transfer occurs in the form of shock wave compression rather than thermal conduction \citep{bdzil2003high}. Meanwhile, the finite length reaction zone, which starts along the leading shock wave and terminates at a sonic plane followed by an unsteady expansion flow, derives energy from the chemical reactions in the explosives and supports the propagating shock front. This close collaboration between shock front and reaction zone causes rapid energy liberation in explosives and generates high-energy gaseous products, which form a fierce expansion flow and are able to do mechanical work on surrounding materials at a remarkable rate.

    \label{fig:detonation_reaction_zone}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Heterogeneous detonation}

Detonation in explosive materials rapidly releases chemical energy and amasses kinetic and thermal energy. The accumulated energy is then dissipated through a variety of means, such as the formation of pressure waves and thermal radiation. Granular additives such as glass particles or aluminum powders are widely used in explosives to either mitigate or enhance the overall performance \citep{baer1986two, milne2010dynamic, zhang2012metalized, chiu2017dynamic}.

Depending on the property of particles, the granular additives can be either inert or energetic. In the former case, particles participate mechanically in the detonation process and act as blast mitigants through absorbing kinetic and thermal energy. When particles are energetic, the timescale of particle ignition and combustion is usually greater than that of explosive detonation, particularly for particles with relatively large sizes. Particles are first dispersed with a significantly increased surface area to volume ratio and then react under the rapid mixing with the detonation products or later with air \citep{zhang2012metalized}. The primary heat release from metal particle combustion often occurs behind the propagating detonation reaction zone and has a very limited contribution to sustaining detonation.

Therefore, although energy release from the oxidation of energetic particles can significantly enhance the pressure work and the post-detonation blast wave and hence improve the overall performance of explosives, shock wave dispersion rather than chemical reaction dominates the early-stage interactions between explosives and particles for both inert and energetic particles \citep{milne2010dynamic, zhang2012metalized}. The added solid particles introduces inhomogeneities in the explosives, which interact with detonation waves and result in heterogeneous detonation. In general, the process of a heterogeneous detonation involves multiscale physics that comprise microscale, mesoscale, and macroscale interactions.

\subsubsection{Microscale interaction}

At the microscale level, the propagation of detonation shock front causes molecular excitation, vibration, and chemical decomposition and reaction in the condensed explosive, which increase kinetic energy, temperature, pressure and further produce expansion work to support the propagation of the shock front.

The pressure of the detonation shock in high explosives may reach $1.0 \times 10^{10} - 5.0 \times 10^{10} \Unit{Pa}$ with propagation speed ranging from $6.0 \times 10^3 - 9.0 \times 10^3 \Unit{m/s}$ \citep{bdzil2003high}. Heating the explosive molecules and initiating chemical reactions, the detonation shock effectively converts the explosives into high-pressure and high-temperature gaseous products, resulting fierce macroscale explosion and expansion behaviors.

\subsubsection{Mesoscale interaction}

While the effects of the structural arrangement of molecules and microstructural imperfections are manifested at the microscale level, and the rapid energy release and expansion processes can be described at the macroscale level with continuum modeling, an intermediate scale, which covers the geometric length scales of $1.0 \times 10^{-7} - 1.0 \times 10^{-3} \Unit{m}$ and the time horizons of $1.0 \times 10^{-6} - 1.0 \times 10^{-3} \Unit{s}$ \citep{ripley2012acceleration}, is required to characterize the heterogeneity of explosives at the granular scale introduced by particle additives and is referred to as the mesoscale.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{hetero_detonation_reaction_zone}
    \caption{Heterogeneous detonation with grain-scale effects introduced by particle additives. The schematic diagram is adapted from the work of \citet{bdzil2003high} and \citet{ripley2012acceleration}. In the current diagram, the detonation reaction zone length is assumed to be much larger than particle diameter.}
    \label{fig:hetero_detonation_reaction_zone}
\end{figure}

As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:hetero_detonation_reaction_zone}, grain-scale heterogeneities can cause intricate mesoscale physics, including strongly coupled shock-shock, shock-particle, and particle-particle interactions.

The presence of voids, density discontinuities, irregular material interfaces, and other inhomogeneities causes shock reflection, diffraction, and interference patterns, especially at the leading edges of particles, where strong wave reflection happens, and at concave regions of neighboring particles, where shock waves collide. These shock-shock interactions not only influence the detonation front curvature and the propagation behavior of detonation waves, but also produce local hotspots and pressure fluctuations at material interfaces, affecting the stability of detonation and granular payload motion.

When interacting with particles, detonation waves transmit strong pressure waves into particles. Due to the shock impedance differences between explosives and particles, a wave speed mismatch between the shock traveling in explosives and the shock propagating in particles usually presents. The wave reflections and interactions in the detonation flow result in local pressure jumps and velocity discontinuities around particles, which initially and impulsively accelerates the particle material. As the detonation waves propagate over particles, the length of detonation reaction zone may be considerably increased due to the energy transfer from detonation waves to particles. The density ratio of explosives to metal particles and length ratio of detonation reaction zone to particle diameter are important measurable parameters to characterize the effectiveness of energy transfer and the shock propagation behaviors at material interfaces, respectively. The dominance of mesoscale shock-particle interaction changes from phase-frozen shock to shock diffraction at interfaces when the ratio of detonation reaction zone length to particle diameter decreases \citep{ripley2012acceleration}.

Under shock compaction, particles experience collision, agglomeration, deformation, and even fragmentation. The granular payload is first compacted with an increased particle volume fraction. Then, subjecting to a diverging expansion, the particle system undergoes a dense-to-dilute transition characterized by a decreasing particle volume fraction \citep{zhang2001explosive}.

\subsubsection{Macroscale cluster and jet formation}

The introduced grain-scale heterogeneities lead to coupled mesoscale interactions between the detonation reaction zone, shock waves, and solid particles. Under high rates of momentum and energy transfer resulting from shock compaction and subsequent expansion flow, the mesoscale interactions are effectively enhanced and later are manifested via complex macroscale phenomena as the expansion proceeds. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:jet_formation}, one important phenomenon is the formation of coherent particle clustering and jetting structures. Influencing the mass concentration and related particle reaction and energy release, the underlying physical mechanism is of significant interest to study flow instability and turbulent mixing in heterogeneous detonation and explosion \citep{zhang2010hybrid, zhang2012metalized}.

\subsection{Clustering and jetting instability}

In experiments concerning the explosive dispersal of liquids \citep{zhang2010hybrid, milne2010dynamic, frost2012particle, zhang2015large}, dry powders \citep{zhang2010hybrid, milne2010dynamic, frost2012particle, zhang2012metalized, xue2013explosively}, or hybrid liquid-powder mixtures \citep{zhang2001explosive, zhang2010hybrid, frost2012particle, bai2018experimental} in a stratified \citep{zhang2010hybrid, milne2010dynamic, frost2012particle, zhang2012metalized, xue2013explosively, zhang2015large, bai2018experimental} or premixed \citep{zhang2001explosive} burster-payload configuration with a cylindrical \citep{zhang2010hybrid, frost2012particle, zhang2012metalized, zhang2015large, bai2018experimental} or spherical \citep{zhang2001explosive, milne2010dynamic, frost2012particle, xue2013explosively} charge shape, a dual hierarchy of particle jets featuring a limited number of large primary jets accompanied by numerous small fine jets, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:large_scale_jet_formation}, was frequently observed, although different configurations can influence the number and length scales of the formed jets. In general, the fine jets occurred at the outer payload-air interface immediately after the fragmentation of casing, and the primary jets emerged out of the surface of the fine jets at a later time. While the fine jets dissipated through aerodynamic interaction and destroyed by payload expansion as the dispersal proceeds, the primary jets persisted as coherent jetting structures for a longer time. This jetting structure can be developed within an expansion length of several times the initial charge diameter \citep{zhang2015large}.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]

    \label{fig:large_scale_jet_formation}
\end{figure}

Casing fragmentation at the inner burster-payload and outer payload-air interfaces could enhance the interfacial behaviors and hence the formation of particle clusters and jets, particularly for liquid payloads \citep{zhang2015large, bai2018experimental}. Strong shocks generated by detonation can induce plastic deformation and agglomeration of solid grains such as those made of aluminum to form a casing-like structure near the inner burster-payload interface, which subsequently fragments under expansion and introduces interfacial instabilities \citep{frost2017fracture}. Less affected by the compression and plastic deformation, liquids can still reveal granular behaviors after breakup and mixing with air. The formation of coherent particle clustering and jetting structures with a dual hierarchy was also observed in the absence of casings and plastic deformations, such as in experiments on dispersed flour or polystyrene powders using Hele-Shaw cells with blast of moderate overpressures \citep{rodriguez2013solid, rodriguez2014external, xue2018dual}, in which particle rings were confined between two closely separated parallel plates and dispersed by a central gas burster. This consistency suggests an inherent clustering and jetting instability in impulsively dispersed granular materials.

Compared with 3D spherical or cylindrical settings, quasi-2D Hele-Shaw cell configurations \citep{rodriguez2013solid, rodriguez2014external, xue2018dual} have provided better visualization of the dispersal evolution. Nonetheless, extra effects can be introduced by the confining plates, such as wall boundaries, burster fluid tending to escape near the upper plate, and payload might dragged by the lower plate under gravity and plate friction. When considered as the zero-surface-tension limit of a high viscous fluid, granular materials such as spherical glass beads dispersed by a gas burster can exhibit the finger-like branching pattern featured in Saffman--Taylor instabilities (STI) \citep{cheng2008towards}, particularly at the early fragmentation stage of the payload. Widely studied via the displacement of a viscous fluid by a less viscous one in Hele-Shaw cells, STI \citep{saffman1958penetration} has been linked to the patten formation in granular materials among recent studies \citep{johnsen2006pattern, cheng2008towards}, in which granular dissipation instead of the classical viscous damping is characterized as the stabilizing mechanism for counterbalancing the destabilizing pressure gradient.

From the perspective of accelerated material interfaces with density disparity and initial interfacial nonuniformity, particle clusters and jets at the inner burster-payload and outer payload-air interfaces can be related to the Rayleigh--Taylor instability (RTI) \citep{lord1883investigation, taylor1950instability} and Richtmyer--Meshkov instability (RMI) \citep{richtmyer1960taylor, meshkov1969instability}, in which RMI can be considered as an impulsive RTI subjected to shock rather than continuous acceleration \citep{kull1991theory}.

RTI and RMI can grow initial surface corrugations with locally misaligned pressure and density gradients in the form of spikes, bubbles, and fingers \citep{kull1991theory}. One example is supernova explosion generated by the energy release from the gravitational collapse of a star that has exhausted nuclear fuel \citep{burrows2000supernova}, in which astrophysical-scale RTI fingers develop in the process of the core medium accelerating into the denser interstellar medium \citep{burrows2000supernova, wang2001instabilities}. Another example is inertial confinement fusion implosion, in which a fusion target, a spherical pellet consists of layered materials such as an ablator, a pusher, and a fuel core, is compressed to the fuel ignition point by a high-energy source for fusion reactions \citep{lindl1992progress}. RTI, accompanied by RMI, is recognized as the primary cause of the asymmetric rupture of the outer ablator-pusher interface in the inward acceleration phase. The amplified perturbations via RTI will feed through the shell and subsequently seed the development of RTI at the inner pusher-fuel interface when the pellet shell is decelerated by the high pressure building up inside the shell \citep{lindl1992progress, lindl1995development}.

The macroscale explosive dispersal of granular materials shares many similarities, such as burster-payload interaction, layered material shells, rapid acceleration under intensive energy release, and shock presence, with astrophysical supernova explosions and microscale inertial confinement fusion implosions with an inverse acceleration direction. Through measuring the growth rates of particle jets, recent Hele-Shaw cell studies \citep{xue2018dual} on blast-dispersed flour rings suggest that the formation of fine jets at the outer payload-air interface can also be seen as a form of RTI. Initiated very early but revealed later, primary jets are only weakly linked to RTI due to the discrepancy in timescales and growth rates \citep{milne2010dynamic, xue2018dual}. Therefore, a distinct evolution process should be proposed for the primary and fine jets, respectively, in which numerical simulations could better reveal the early time multiphase interactions through visualizing the fluid and solid motions simultaneously, particularly for the complex coupling between gas and granular motions and the nonlinear force-chain networks in granular materials.

\subsection{Modeling issues and challenges}

The formation of particle clusters and jets involves a fluid-solid system that covers multiple temporal and spatial scales. In numerical modeling of a multiphase and multiscale system, a small-scale such as micro/mesoscale model built on the first principle of physical laws can be very accurate but not efficient enough for large systems, while a large-scale such as macroscale model built on continuum mechanics can be efficient but not accurate enough for resolving small-scale structures. Therefore, multiscale modeling that employs a hierarchy of reference frames and physical laws to describe the system on different spatial scales and provide varying levels of details is needed to balance accuracy and efficiency. According to the possible reference frames for the fluid and solid phases, two widely used approaches \citep{van2008numerical} are Eulerian--Eulerian and Eulerian--Lagrangian descriptions.

An Eulerian--Eulerian approach, referred to as macroscale modeling, treats each phase as a separate flow using a continuum model, in which the constitutive equation for granular flow can be derived from soil mechanics \citep{brennen2005fundamentals}, visco-plastic analogy \citep{jop2006constitutive}, or kinetic theory \citep{brilliantov2010kinetic} when considering the granular flow as elastic-quasistatic, visco-plastic, and rapid collisional, respectively, and describes the phase interactions such as drag forces via interphase exchange source terms \citep{van2008numerical}. Due to the continuum modeling, granular physics such as particle motions and collisions are embedded in volume-averaged field quantities, limiting the ability for resolving grain-scale structures and physics \citep{agrawal2001role}. Meanwhile, an Eulerian--Lagrangian approach describes the fluid and solid phases using a continuum model and a discrete model, respectively. As each solid is tracked as a discrete entity, individual granular behaviors can be modeled in detail.

Depending on whether phase interfaces are resolved in the coupling of fluid-solid interactions, Eulerian--Lagrangian models can be further categorized into non-resolved and resolved models, referred to as semi-mesoscale and mesoscale modeling, respectively. That is, length and model scales herein characterized by molecules, non-resolved grains, resolved grains, and continua are referred to as microscale, semi-mesoscale, mesoscale, and macroscale, respectively. The classification of length scales can be a matter of debate in the literature. When focusing on the modeling analogy to collisional molecular dynamics but ignoring the physical disparity between molecules and grains, the grain-scale is referred to as the microscale in references like \citep{agrawal2001role, tenneti2014particle}, in which granular clusters with sizes being $10-100$ times granular diameters are categorized into mesoscale. In a non-resolved model such as the discrete element model \citep{tsuji1993discrete, stewart2018soft, xue2018dual}, the Eulerian grid is usually several orders of magnitude larger than solid sizes. While solids in the Lagrangian frame describing the solid phase preserve a finite volume and interact through spring-based collision rules, solids in the fluid domain are treated as point sources and sinks of momentum, whose interaction with the fluid phase requires closure laws similar to those in Eulerian--Eulerian models \citep{van2008numerical}.

In an explosive dispersal, in addition to the multiphase and multiscale properties, the fluid-solid system experiences a flow regime with dense-to-dilute transitions characterized by a time-dependent particle volume fraction $\phi$, in which the flow regime changes from a granular flow ($\phi > 50\%$) featuring inelastic multibody contact and collisions to a dense gas-granule flow ($1\% \le \phi \le 50\%$) characterizing strong gas-granule and granule-granule interactions and further to a dilute gas-granule flow ($\phi < 1\%$) outlining aerodynamic forces and less severe boundary layer interactions among individual particles \citep{zhang2001explosive}. In supplying closure laws for Eulerian--Eulerian and non-resolved Eulerian--Lagrangian models, while standard models perform relatively well for dilute gas-granule flows with low-pressure conditions, momentum exchange laws that can well describe flow regimes with dense-to-dilute transitions and shocked flow conditions still undergoes active development through experimental correlations \citep{zhang2001explosive, ling2012interaction, demauro2017unsteady}, numerical simulations \citep{ling2012interaction, mehta2016numerical, mcgrath2018modeling}, or surrogate models \citep{sen2018evaluation}.

Adopting a resolved Eulerian--Lagrangian approach can achieve direct simulations that avoid the necessity of correlated closure laws and automatically activate interphase interactions via boundary conditions at phase interfaces. The challenges are then mainly shifted to irregular and moving boundaries, mesh generation and regeneration, computational efficiency and robustness, and particle-particle interactions. Advances in Cartesian-grid methods such as immersed boundary methods \citep{peskin1972flow}, immersed interface methods \citep{leveque1997immersed, sethian2000structural}, ghost fluid methods \citep{fedkiw1999non, fedkiw2002coupling}, and embedded boundary methods \citep{wang2011algorithms, wang2015computational} have greatly simplified the grid generation and regeneration for treating irregular and moving boundaries using non-body-conformal Cartesian grids \citep{fadlun2000combined, tseng2003ghost, mittal2005immersed, kapahi2013three, uddin2014cartesian}, which enable cost-effective direct simulations for explosive dispersal problems, provided a method that can robustly handle irregular, moving, and colliding geometries with shocked flow conditions.

Under a dense setting, particle interactions can strongly influence the stresses in the fluid-solid mixture \citep{walton1993numerical, ling2011importancea, kempe2014relevance} and generate nonlinear force-chain networks in the granular cloud \citep{nagel2017experimental}. With fundamental preconditions like random, binary collision, and sufficient inter-particle distance, kinetic theory has been extended to describe granular systems with non-Maxwellian velocity distribution \citep{brilliantov2010kinetic}. Nonetheless, multibody collisions are excluded through assuming being comparably rare and not affecting the statistical properties of the system. However, the dispersal problem concerned herein contains an initial granular system with sustained contacts among inherently dissipative grains, in which multibody collisions are responsible for the transfer of momentum and energy and can no longer be reasonably excluded, introducing challenges in solving collision detection and response. Multibody collision in theory remains as an unsolved problem \citep{ivanov1995multiple}. A few approximation attempts such as sequential pairwise collision \citep{guendelman2003nonconvex} and perfectly inelastic non-contact collision \citep{xu2013formation} have been explored in interface-resolved multibody collision modeling. Nonetheless, a deterministic multibody contact and collision model can better facilitate the investigations of the particle clustering and jetting problem.

\section{Motivations and findings}

For the purpose of advancing the understanding of particle clustering and jetting dynamics, particularly the governing instability of primary jets, through capturing mesoscale multiphase interactions, this thesis develops a resolved Eulerian--Lagrangian approach to directly simulate  gas-solid flow with shock-shock, shock-particle, and particle-particle interactions, in which the Eulerian gird describing the fluid phase is at least one order of magnitude less than particle sizes to resolve phase interfaces, fluid-solid interaction is via enforcing boundary conditions at phase interfaces, and particle-particle interaction is through a deterministic multibody contact and collision model with parameterized coefficients of restitution and friction.

The framework is implemented to create a computational solver and then validated for solving flow with irregular, moving, and colliding granular bodies. Employing the theory of Gurney velocity \citep{gurney1943initial}, a valid statistical dissipative property of the framework in solving explosively dispersed granular materials is also demonstrated. Combining direct simulations herein and experimental observations in the literature, an explanation for particle clustering and jetting instabilities that admits a dual structure and concerns the effects of shock compaction, interfacial instabilities, inelastic collisions, interstitial fluid, particle properties, payload morphologies, and burster-payload relations is proposed.
