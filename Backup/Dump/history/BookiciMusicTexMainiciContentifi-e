\section{Theory}
\subsection{Vibrating String}
A vibration in a string is a wave. Usually a vibrating string produces a sound whose frequency in most cases is constant. Therefore, since frequency characterizes the pitch, the sound produced is a constant note. Vibrating strings are the basis of any string instrument like guitar, cello, or piano.

The speed of propagation of a wave in a string ($v$) is proportional to the square root of the tension of the string ($T$) and inversely proportional to the square root of the linear density ($\mu$) of the string.
\[
    v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}
\]

    \label{fig:StringParameters}
\end{figure}

Once the speed of propagation is known, the frequency of the sound produced by the string can be calculated. The speed of propagation of a wave is equal to the wavelength $\lambda$ divided by the period $\tau$, or multiplied by the frequency $f$ :
\[
    v = \frac{\lambda}{\tau} = \lambda f.
\]

If the length of the string is $L$, the fundamental harmonic is the one produced by the vibration whose nodes are the two ends of the string, so $L$ is half of the wavelength of the fundamental harmonic. Hence one obtains Mersenne's laws:
\[
    f = \frac{v}{2L} = { 1 \over 2L } \sqrt{T \over \mu} 
\]

where $T$ is the tension, $\mu$ is the linear density (that is, the mass per unit length), and $L$ is the length of the vibrating part of the string. Therefore:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the shorter the string, the higher the frequency of the fundamental
    \item the higher the tension, the higher the frequency of the fundamental
    \item the lighter the string, the higher the frequency of the fundamental
\end{itemize}

Moreover, if we take the nth harmonic as having a wavelength given by $\lambda_n = 2L/n$, then we easily get an expression for the frequency of the nth harmonic:
\[
    f_n = \frac{nv}{2L}
\]

And for a string under a tension $T$ with density $\mu$, then
\[
    f_n = \frac{n}{2L}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} 
\]

\paragraph{Tone}
%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A musical tone is a steady periodic sound. A musical tone is characterized by its duration, pitch, intensity (or loudness), and timbre (or quality). The notes used in music can be more complex than musical tones, as they may include aperiodic aspects, such as attack transients, vibrato, and envelope modulation.

A simple tone, or pure tone, has a sinusoidal waveform. A complex tone is any musical tone that is not sinusoidal, but is periodic, such that it can be described as a sum of simple tones with harmonically related frequencies.

%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\paragraph{Pitch}
%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Pitch is a perceptual property that allows the ordering of sounds on a frequency-related scale. Pitches are compared as "higher" and "lower" in the sense associated with musical melodies, which require sound whose frequency is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise. Pitch is a major auditory attribute of musical tones, along with duration, loudness, and timbre. Pitch may be quantified as a frequency, but pitch is not a purely objective physical property; it is a subjective psychoacoustical attribute of sound. 

Pitch is an auditory sensation in which a listener assigns musical tones to relative positions on a musical scale based primarily on the frequency of vibration. Pitch is closely related to frequency, but the two are not equivalent. Frequency is an objective, scientific concept, whereas pitch is subjective. Sound waves themselves do not have pitch, and their oscillations can be measured to obtain a frequency. It takes a human mind to map the internal quality of pitch. 

%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\paragraph{Pitch Class}
%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In music, a pitch class is a set of all pitches that are a whole number of octaves apart, e.g., the pitch class C consists of the Cs in all octaves. "The pitch class C stands for all possible Cs, in whatever octave position." Thus, using scientific pitch notation, the pitch class "C" is the set

\{Cn : n is an intege\} $=$ \{..., C-2, C-1, C0, C1, C2, C3 ...\}; 

although there is no formal upper or lower limit to this sequence, only a limited number of these pitches are audible to the human ear. Pitch class is important because human pitch-perception is periodic: pitches belonging to the same pitch class are perceived as having a similar "quality" or "color", a property called octave equivalence.

%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\paragraph{Scale}
%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In music, a scale is any set of musical notes ordered by fundamental frequency or pitch. A scale ordered by increasing pitch is an ascending scale, while descending scales are ordered by decreasing pitch. Some scales contain different pitches when ascending than when descending (for instance, see Melodic minor scale).

Often, especially in the context of the common practice period, part or all of a musical work including melody and harmony, is built using the notes of a single scale, which can be conveniently represented on a staff with a standard key signature.

Due to the principle of octave equivalence, scales are generally considered to span a single octave, with higher or lower octaves simply repeating the pattern. A musical scale represents a division of the octave space into a certain number of scale steps, a scale step being the recognizable distance (or interval) between two successive notes of the scale.

A measure of the width of each scale step provides a method to classify scales. For instance, in a chromatic scale each scale step represents a semitone interval, while a major scale is defined by the interval pattern T-T-S-T-T-T-S, where T stands for whole tone (an interval spanning two semitones), and S stands for semitone. Based on their interval patterns, scales are divided into categories including diatonic, chromatic, major, minor, and others.

A specific scale is defined by its characteristic interval pattern and by a special note, known as its first degree (or tonic). The tonic of a scale is the note selected as the beginning of the octave, and therefore as the beginning of the adopted interval pattern. Typically, the name of the scale specifies both its tonic and its interval pattern. For example, C-major indicates a major scale in which C is the tonic.

%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\paragraph{Unison}
%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In music, unison is two or more musical parts sounding the same pitch or at an octave interval, usually at the same time. Rhythmic patterns which are homorhythmic are also call unison.

%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\paragraph{Octave}
%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 In music, an octave (Latin: octavus: eighth) or perfect octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency.  

The most important musical scales are typically written using eight notes, and the interval between the first and last notes is an octave. For example, the C Major scale is typically written C D E F G A B C, the initial and final C's being an octave apart. Two notes separated by an octave have the same letter name and are of the same pitch class.

After the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics. Notes in an octave "ring" together, adding a pleasing sound to music. For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation-the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are musically equivalent in many ways, leading to the convention "that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave". The conceptualization of pitch as having two dimensions, pitch height (absolute frequency) and pitch class (relative position within the octave), inherently include octave circularity. Thus all C\#s, or all 1s (if $C=0$), in any octave are part of the same pitch class.

%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\paragraph{Temperament}
%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An equal temperament is a musical temperament, or a system of tuning, in which every pair of adjacent notes has an identical frequency ratio. As pitch is perceived roughly as the logarithm of frequency, this means that the perceived "distance" from every note to its nearest neighbor is the same for every note in the system.

%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\paragraph{Tune}
%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Tune is a series of musical notes that are sung or played in a particular order to form a piece of music

%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\paragraph{Rhythm}
%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Rhythm is a strong regular repeated pattern of sounds or movements. (from Greek rhythmos, "any regular recurring motion, symmetry" (Liddell and Scott 1996)) generally means a "movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions" (Anon. 1971, 2537). This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to millions of years.

In the performance arts rhythm is the timing of events on a human scale; of musical sounds and silences, of the steps of a dance, or the meter of spoken language and poetry. Rhythm may also refer to visual presentation, as "timed movement through space"

%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\paragraph{Melody}
%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A melody ("singing, chanting"), also tune, voice, or line, is a linear succession of musical tones that the listener perceives as a single entity. In its most literal sense, a melody is a combination of pitch and rhythm, while more figuratively, the term can include successions of other musical elements such as tonal color. It may be considered the foreground to the background accompaniment. A line or part need not be a foreground melody.

Melodies often consist of one or more musical phrases or motifs, and are usually repeated throughout a composition in various forms. Melodies may also be described by their melodic motion or the pitches or the intervals between pitches (predominantly conjunct or disjunct or with further restrictions), pitch range, tension and release, continuity and coherence, cadence, and shape.

The true goal of music--its proper enterprise--is melody. All the parts of harmony have as their ultimate purpose only beautiful melody. Therefore the question of which is the more significant, melody or harmony, is futile. Beyond doubt, the means is subordinate to the end. ---Johann Philipp Kirnberger (1771)

\paragraph{Inlay}
%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Inlay on guitars or similar fretted instruments are decorative materials set into the wooden surface of the instrument using standard inlay techniques.

%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\paragraph{Fingerboard}
%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Fingerboard (also known as a fretboard on fretted instruments) is a part of most stringed instruments. It is a thin, long strip of material, usually wood, that is laminated to the front of the neck of an instrument. The strings run over the fingerboard, between the nut and bridge. To play such an instrument, a musician presses strings down to the fingerboard to change the vibrating length, changing the pitch. This is called stopping the strings.

%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\paragraph{Fret}
%%%%% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Fret is one of the bars on the long thin part of a guitar, etc. Frets show you where to press the strings with your fingers to produce particular sounds. A fingerboard may be fretted, having raised strips of hard material perpendicular to the strings, which the player presses the strings against to stop the strings. Frets let the player stop the string consistently in the same place, and don't dampen string vibrations as much as fingers alone. Frets may be fixed, as on a guitar or mandolin, or movable, as on a lute.
