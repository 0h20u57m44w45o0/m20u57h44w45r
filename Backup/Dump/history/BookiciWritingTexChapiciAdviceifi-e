\section{Professional Preparation Strategy: The Three-Pronged Preparation Strategy}

A strategy, or overall plan, for achieving your goals is necessary because you have limited time, energy, and material resources. The plan should be flexible enough to allow you to explore different possibilities, and at the same time prevent you from running into too many dead ends. It should also allow you to assess progress toward your goals, and to make necessary adjustments along the way. A good strategy gives you a feeling of accomplishment as well as a reference point during your journey, often at times when you need it the most.  Also, fundamental changes are taking place in academia with respect to teaching, research, and other forms of scholarship. Having a strategy that helps prepare you for these changes can be particularly valuable.

    \label{fig:three-part-pre-str}
\end{figure}

The strategy proposed here has three components: (1) Breadth-on-Top-of-Depth, (2) Next-Stage, and (3) Multiple-Option, as shown in Figure 4-3. Each approach complements the other, and all can be carried out simultaneously during your graduate student and postdoc periods. Let us take a look at each of these approaches in detail.

\subsection{Breadth-on-Top-of-Depth}

In the Breadth-on-Top-of-Depth approach, you seek to place your developing expertise in a broad context. By doing so, you are better able to see connections between your work and that of others, to make a more compelling case for your own contribution, and to be able to develop related areas of depth should the situation call for it.

One way to look at the concept is to imagine a capital "T". Here, depth is represented by the stem of the "T" and breadth by the cross bar. The first thing to understand about this concept is what it is not. Breadth-on-Top-of-Depth does not mean breadth in place of depth, nor does it mean breadth over depth in the sense that breadth is more important than depth. Breadth-on-Top-of-Depth means breadth in addition to depth. Developing depth, be it in a research area, another form of scholarship, or the teaching of a particular course, is essential to academic success. You need to be known for something, and that something needs to be both important and unique. The last thing you want to be is "a mile wide and an inch deep." However, there are at least three good reasons for developing breadth in addition to depth. First, by increasing your knowledge and exposure to related areas, you create the possibility of developing additional areas of expertise, "drilling multiple holes," as one faculty member put it.  Second, by knowing what is going on in related areas, you increase the opportunities for collaboration in ways that can enhance your own scholarship. Finally, by placing your work in a larger context, you give it greater meaning and make it more compelling to a larger audience, which in turn makes it easier to justify and support.

The concept of Breadth-on-Top-of-Depth applies to all areas of research and teaching, not just to the choice of a specific research topic.  By way of illustration, consider your choice of a research advisor. No matter who you end up "choosing" as your advisor, this one person will have strengths and limitations with respect to managerial style, knowledge of the field, and contacts with industry and government. In seeking Breadth-on-Top-of-Depth, you will want to identify "complementary" advisors, one or more of whom may be in industry or at another institution. These additional advisors can make up for deficiencies always found in any single advisor. Also, by choosing to work with complementary advisors, you broaden your experience and your exposure to opportunities that would otherwise not be possible.

\subsection{Next-Stage}

In the Next-Stage approach, you think ahead, look ahead, and to some degree act ahead of the stage you (and your future competition) are currently occupying. By doing so, you not only demonstrate your willingness to assume the role of the position you are seeking, but also your readiness to do so. Just as most of the best graduate students began taking graduate courses and/or conducting research as college seniors, you need to begin doing some of the things professors do while you are still a graduate student and postdoc. Today, it is not enough to be outstanding in your current job; you must also demonstrate that you can be successful in the next job for which you want to apply by actually performing in advance some of the activities and responsibilities that are part of that job.

Below are some areas in which demonstrating this "next-stage" competence would be important. No one expects you to demonstrate all of them. However, doing at least some of them will distinguish you from most of your competition, and within limits, the more you can do, the better.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Research—In addition to having identified a dissertation or a postdoctoral research project that is compelling as opposed to just interesting, look for ways to engage in cross-disciplinary and multidisciplinary activities with faculty and students from other areas or departments. Obviously, you will want to pursue such activity with the support of your advisor.
    \item Technical reviewing—Find opportunities, both formal and informal, for you to review papers, grants, and proposals written by others.
    \item Proposal writing—In addition to reviewing the proposals of others and contributing sections to your advisor's proposals, write your own proposals and grant applications for research that you want to do as a professor.
    \item Supervision of other students—As you advance in your development as a graduate student or postdoc, find ways to play a more formal role in the supervision of other students, both undergraduate and graduate.
    \item Publishing—Coauthorship is fine, but make sure you publish at least one article in which you are the first author.
    \item Presentations at conferences—Establish a record of giving technical presentations at conferences in which faculty and industrial researchers are present.
    \item Relations with industry—Visit various research sites and give technical presentations, use equipment, samples, and other industry resources in your research, conduct joint investigations, publish with industrial collaborators, and consider internships and other forms of employment with industry or government laboratories.
    \item Teaching—Plan to acquire at least some experiences beyond those of a typical TA, such as giving lectures, covering sections of a class, or even taking full responsibility for a course.
\end{itemize}

The key steps in the Next-Stage approach are to ask questions (think ahead), make observations (look ahead), and acquire experiences (act ahead) by putting yourself in the right places at the right times and tuning your antenna to the gathering of the right information. The Next-Stage approach involves actively seeking experiences that you are likely to encounter in the future. One particularly useful means is to search and look at the requirements listed in the position recruitment posts related to your future applications very early to make yourself be prepared for the next stage of your career.

\subsection{Multiple-Option}

In the Multiple-Option approach, you prepare concurrently for possible careers in academia, government and industry. By doing things that will make you more attractive to industry and government, you will, paradoxically, make yourself more attractive to academia. This increased attraction occurs because most colleges and universities want science and engineering faculty who can interact effectively with the other two sectors.

\section{Research as a Graduate Student and Postdoc}

Have the breadth to see the problems, and the depth to solve them.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]

    \label{fig:path_academia}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Choosing a Graduate School or Pastdoc Institution.

    Where you go to graduate school determines where you do your postdoc, and where you do your postdoc determines where you become a professor.

    It is important to follow your passion in all matters related to your research. The research experience is too demanding and so full of setbacks and frustrations that if it is not accompanied by a desire, even a zeal for the subject, it is unlikely to be sustained over time. That said, it is also important to realistically match your passion and aspirations with a levelheaded assessment of your skills and present level of achievement.

        Consistent with the above factors, you should choose a graduate school with the reputation of the university, and particularly the department of interest uppermost in your mind. Being able to attend a school with a strong reputation is more than just a statement about your capabilities and undergraduate preparation. The reputations of graduate schools are built on their faculties and on their graduate students and postdocs. Each attracts and enhances the other. The better the combination, the more likely you are to acquire the experiences that will make you attractive to other institutions as a future professor.

        For postdocs, all of the above comments apply, but in addition, it is particularly important to pay attention to the reputation of your potential supervisor. For new Ph.D.s, the first question often asked is, "Where did you get your degree?", but for recent postdocs it is, "Under whom did you postdoc?"

\item Choosing a Research Topic

It is really important to do the right research as well as to do the research right. You need to do "wow" research, research that is compelling, not just interesting. It is important that you take the time to find a problem that is interesting to you, significantly complex, and compelling.

The knowledge, expertise, and skills that you gain early on will form the foundation for later investigations. By choosing the right topic now (Breadth-on-Top-of-Depth), you help ensure your research viability in the future. "The most successful research topics are narrowly focused and carefully defined, but are important parts of a broad-ranging, complex problem"

\item Choosing a Dissertation Advisor/Postdoc Supervisor

A rabbit is sunning himself outside his house when a fox comes along and tells him that he is going to eat him for lunch. The rabbit explains, rather smugly, that the fox cannot eat him because he is working on his dissertation, the subject of which is the superiority of rabbits over foxes and wolves. The fox laughs, but the rabbit persuades him to come into his house and examine his dissertation with the understanding that if the fox did not agree that the title was correct, he could eat the rabbit for lunch. The fox follows the rabbit into the house and never emerges.

A few hours later, the rabbit is out sunning himself again when a wolf comes by. The above scene repeats itself with the same result.

Later in the afternoon the rabbit is outside again when a squirrel comes by and comments on the satisfied look on the rabbit's face. The rabbit explains that he is indeed satisfied because he has just completed his dissertation on the superiority of rabbits over foxes and wolves. The squirrel is skeptical, but agrees to follow the rabbit into his house to examine his dissertation.

In the house is a computer on which appears the completed dissertation. On the floor on one side of the room are the bones of a fox. On the other side, the bones of a wolf. In the corner sits a lion.

The rabbit smiles and says to the squirrel, "You know, it doesn't really matter what your research topic is, as long as you have the right advisor."

Well, not quite, although choosing the right advisor is certainly of comparable importance to choosing the right research topic. "The advisor is the primary gatekeeper for the professional self-esteem of the student, the rate of progress toward the degree, and access to future opportunities".

First, keep in mind that you want an advisor who is in a research area in which you have, or seek to develop, a strong interest. This element is essential, given all the inevitable difficulties you are going to experience. At the same time, you want a professor who understands that "finding the right problem" is half the battle, and that he or she needs to give you the encouragement and time to do so.

\item Writing Your Own Research Proposals

"If I had my life to do over again, I would have written half a dozen proposals before I got my Ph.D., instead of just contributing to one or two. Once you have a faculty position, chasing dollars is the number-one activity; the more experience you bring to it, the better off you will be. Use your research advisor to help you learn to write proposals, before you start sending things in blind to funding agencies."

Writing represents a very high level of thinking, much higher than conversation. That is why it is so difficult, and why, when it is done well, so valuable.  It does get easier with practice, so you need to get started. Look for every opportunity to put your case in writing and to receive the critical feedback your efforts will bring. Completing such an important and difficult task brings many rewards.

Writing proposals and applying for grants require the discipline and insights that will help throughout a professional career. Commitment, thoroughness, and patience are essential components of grant getting. Tolerance of failure is also required, because many proposals are rejected. Overcoming the trauma of rejection is an important lesson for the professional. I know researchers who have received dozens of grants during their lives. This has often meant confronting five times that many rejections.  Researchers have to develop emotional strength to survive. Survival skills develop with the self-confidence that comes from research accomplishments, and these skills are useful in one's personal life as well as work.

Preparing your own proposals helps you confront the Breadth-on-Top-of-Depth challenge by requiring you to place your work in a larger context. Science writer Anne Simon Moffat discusses the keys to successful grantsmanship with an interesting example from biology:

"A proposal to isolate and characterize a new gene or to describe a new molecular structure may not be enough to snare a grant, unless an explanation is offered on how these discoveries relate to larger problems, such as gene regulation or structure/function relations. Take protein crystal structures, which are now being solved by crystallographers at a rate of about one per day. The techniques and materials are expensive so proposals have to go beyond "another new one." There's got to be "a good story behind the protein," says crystallographer Joe Kraut of the University of California, San Diego."

Perhaps the best place to start is with your dissertation proposal. Some departments require all students to produce such a document, but even if yours does not, you should do so anyway. Not only will it give you much needed experience, it will help ensure that you are undertaking an effort that has the support of your advisor and other key faculty. It also helps you understand clearly what you are, and are not, committing to, and what is at least the initially projected time frame for the completion of your work. The same thing can be done as you begin your postdoc work. Here, it is particularly important to have expectations about what you can accomplish and when, and one way to help ensure this understanding is through a written proposal that you and your supervisor agree on before you start. The postdoc period is also a time to develop proposals that can help launch your academic career.

As with anything else, proposal writing improves with practice, and persistence can be key. If you can focus your attention on a grantor's interests, show how your research matches that interest, and then demonstrate that your research has a wider theoretical application, you will have made a good start down the road to funding.

\item Carrying Out Your Research
\item Publishing

To succeed you must make your talents well known and widely appreciated.  Publishing provides you with an important way to accomplish that. Your papers, available in libraries around the world, represent not only your product but also your resume.

When it comes to publishing, having the right perspective is essential. If you view publishing as a burden and as a requirement imposed by the system, then you will do it reluctantly, if at all, and are unlikely to feel proud of the outcome.  On the other hand, if you view publishing as a natural part of your scholarship, as a way to take some of the credit for what you have done and to communicate the results of your hard work to your colleagues and beyond, then you are likely to set standards that will help make you a professional success. The important thing is to get in the publishing habit now, and to treat publishing as a forethought, not an afterthought. You can do this by creating the expectation in your own mind that you will do publishable work.

Publishing produces a permanent record, so you want to be sure what you produce is of high quality. Even though the peer review process rejects far more than it accepts, a lot of not-so-memorable work gets through. This reality means that ultimately it is your own standards that should determine what to do. If you plan to do publishable work right from the beginning, it will help set the baseline for the research that follows. Many people find it helpful to get in the habit of writing as they go along, not just after they complete their scholarship. Each (writing and scholarship) reinforces the other.

Most scientific fields are small, and therefore the immediate community you work in will be essentially divided between people who are your friends, those who are your enemies and those who are genuinely disinterested. As one senior colleague once said, the reviewers in your list should be experts in the field, and they should be friends. If you have doubts whether someone is a friend or not, or you think they may be struggling to get to a certain result before you, you are better off not suggesting them as a referee. This is all very well, but you should also realize is that these referees will be considered by the committee as "your" referees and thus anything positive will be somewhat discounted, while anything negative from them can be very damaging, much more so than for a referee you did not choose. Be very sure you know who your supporters are. This is certainly a case of "Better safe than sorry." More importantly, "Know thy neighbor."

Science is clearly not well served if you have to struggle to get your work done, because someone else (typically an envious competitor) is trying to trip you up. On the other hand, science is ill-served when poor and even erroneous science is published — but this may well be the same opinion of your detractors concerning your work. The system has to accommodate both points of view to some extent. (It might seem that the best thing to do is to try to become friends with all your competitors, join efforts and do the work together. Unfortunately, this is not always possible. Even with the best in the world such alliances are inherently unstable.)

In essence, what we have presented are the rules of the peer review game. If you want to participate, you should at least be aware of them, even if you do not take advantage of them.

In general, if your work is sufficiently important, it will be published even if not in the journal of your first choice or of first rank. If published it will in due time be recognized for what it is, and be copiously cited, even if it was not published in one of the very best, high-profile journals.  These "late bloomers" can be identified by citation indices if one is willing to take the trouble. The system does work more or less.  "Excellence will out" — eventually.

To put it somewhat brutally, one can say that citations are to be thought of as an exchange currency. If you cite other people's work (whether they really deserve to be cited or not is, cynically speaking, a different issue altogether) they will be happy. This is a good way to make friends in your community. It should not have escaped your notice that if you cite someone in your work they will be more likely to read it more carefully and more likely to cite you in their own work. Thus, having many citations to your work to show (for example when applying for a promotion) has become a matter of survival in today's scientific world. Of course, this does not mean you should cite someone's work even if it is of poor quality, just to make new friends. But it does no real harm to cite good work which is a bit peripheral.

On the other hand, if you forget to acknowledge your predecessors and their achievements, either intentionally or accidentally, this is one of the best and fastest ways to make enemies in your field of research. Also, the best way to stop a charge of plagiarism is to cite anything which might be considered a source.

\item Attending Conferences and Other Professional Meetings

Conferences are ideal places to find out what is hot, and not so hot, in your field, observe the various debates and controversies underway, meet interesting people, make contacts for future interactions, and in general participate in the milieu of the professionals in your field. All aspects of your preparation strategy can be carried out to some degree at professional conferences.

\item Giving talks on your research.

When it comes to talks on your research and related activities, you need to do two things: (1) give them, and (2) obtain honest feedback on how well they were received. The second does not always automatically follow from the first, so you may need to take special steps to ensure that it does.  You owe it to yourself to probe beyond comments such as, "nice talk," or "enjoyed your presentation." Acknowledge the compliment, and then ask the person giving it if they have any suggestions on how you might improve the presentation in the future. With such an opening you will often receive some very specific pointers that can be quite useful.

\item Supervising Other Researchers

Taking on supervisory duties is clearly part of the Next-Stage approach. It is also the kind of activity that will help you in maintaining multiple employment options. As we saw earlier, industry and government are looking for people who can communicate well with their colleagues and who can eventually manage projects and programs. Therefore, everything you do in the area of supervision will prepare you for positions in all three employment sectors.

\item Managing Research Projects and Programs

The step up to actually managing a research project or even a small research program is something more likely to be done as a postdoc than as a graduate student. In fact, most postdocs do not even go this far, but the ones who do are sure to make themselves much more competitive. Doing so requires you to think more broadly (Breadth-on-Top-of-Depth), gives you obvious Next-Stage experiences, and in most cases brings you in contact with opportunities in two or more employment sectors (Multiple-Option).

As you go from one stage to the next, the role you play changes. As a student, I was expected to excel in a specific subject, and I was judged by my individual contribution. As a postdoc, I was expected to be more of a team player, to contribute to the researchers around me and review their papers, as well as run a complete project and write my own proposals. As a professor, things changed again, and now I have a dozen balls in the air. Given all of this, I strongly recommend that as a graduate student, you do some of the work of a postdoc, and as a postdoc, you do some of the work of a professor. Not only does it make things easier when you get to the next stage, but it also separates you from the rest of your competition.

\item Networking

Many of the activities discussed above are illustrative of a more general activity called "networking," the process of connecting with others with whom you have a mutual interest. The term has gotten a bit of a bad name of late because it is overused and/or used in the wrong way. However, networking is absolutely essential to your strategy of obtaining contacts that can make a difference in your path to becoming a professor.

Most of us want to believe that our good work will be enough to get us what we want, but it will not. Recognition and opportunity come to those who also have good contacts. I began to feel good about networking when a colleague whom I respect a great deal confided to me that he spent $60\%$ of this time doing the best damn job he could, $20\%$ of his time making sure that everyone else knew what a good job he was doing, and another $20\%$ of his time looking for something better to do. You may quarrel with the percentages, but the reality is that you are going to have to make contacts and market yourself as well as do substantive work in order to get the recognition and opportunities you want and deserve.

The beauty of networking is that, if done right, almost everything you do will rebound to your benefit if you end up choosing an academic career. In the open environment of academia, all your contacts in industry, government, and at other colleges and universities will be important to you. In one way or another, all of these contacts will be your future colleagues. Remember, every visitor to your department or laboratory, those you meet at conferences, at other schools, and during visits to industrial and government sites are both current and future resources for you.

\item Teaching Experiences Prior to Becoming a Professor
\item Applying for Positions

"We typically get 300-400 applications for every opening. The main reason is that everyone is applying for everything. Only about $10\%$ of the applications are even in the ballpark, although that's still a large number for us. The key is persistence and an ability to convince us that you will be a good match with what we need."

"My experience is that it is far better to apply to fewer schools well, tailoring your application to each school, than to blindly apply to a whole bunch of schools. In most places, search committees are looking for a fit with other faculty members in the department, not an overlap, but not too far out either."

Herein lies the key to increasing your prospects. You have to identify a manageable number of openings consistent with your abilities, and then do an outstanding job of applying to each of them.

Your major effort should go into identifying up to a dozen schools for which you are prepared to do the background research to enable you to present powerful, targeted applications. Beyond that, as time permits, identify another dozen or so schools that fit within the general boundaries of your explorations. Then take the time to prepare a letter and curriculum vitae having at least a reasonable chance of getting the attention of the search committee. Your main time and energy must go into the schools for which you have reason to believe there is a very strong match.

"The cover letter is the most important thing in your application. I wrote the best cover letter ever, and it got me the interview. I took the time to tailor it perfectly to the school and department. This took a lot of research, but it paid off."

\end{enumerate}
